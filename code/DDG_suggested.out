This latest version changed my default map location from SD card to main memory, then told me I didn't have enough memory to update my maps, although this version only updates changes. I then had to download my maps again after changing the location, as it STILL doesn't recognise that I already have downloaded maps!  Just to add that I have used maps from my sdcard correctly for a few years now!  This rating only applies to the latest version which screwed up my configuration. This forced me to re download maps that are already on my sdcard, as even after changing the location back to the sdcard, the app still didn't check for the existent of valid maps in the selected location.

Downloaded this app to use on a trip. It clearly said I had the offline map downloaded yet when I entered in the exact address or a category.. It said zero results found even though I knew the address was within my downloaded map. Poor experience. I reconnected with at a McDonald's and only then did the address show up. If this app requires you to have data then google maps is better.
---
this app is an absolute rubbish. the new update is real catastrophe. the settings go back to default each time and the app loses the address for map storage files which results in asking to download the map data again. i had bookmarked the location of my hotel but then when i was in Spain it failed show me even the downloaded maps. just rubbish.

Good but missing Custom Post Type support. I add CPTs into most of my sites and only being able to update blog entries is very limiting. Image handling is a bit buggy. Really good when fixing typos or creating quick posts. The earlier versions of this app were way more functional.
---
Doesn't post a new blog if I clear the 'uploading...' notification The new blog posting process is somehow interrupted and doesn't finish completely if I clear the 'uploading...' notification.  As a user I would assume that such a process should continue in the background.  Next, if I open the app again, it doesn't show any indication of the ongoing process which doesn't give me any kind of update (of whether the new blog got completely/half way uploaded/or cancelled).  To check this, if I manually click the 'refresh' icon on top-right corner, it gives a warning message which is really doesn't help the user what his/her action should be.

This app becomes more and more idiotic. Stats are badly organized, slow and do not give relevant data. Posting and editing tools are worthless. This last stupid update is enough for me. Uninstall. Edit: I used this app for stats, and implementing "Insights" was bad! Loading is slow and with the last update you cannot view individual posts. New Wordpress post editor in a browser lacks a lot options, in app even more: options missing concerning pictures, buttons for formatting hidden... 500 limit
---
Strips tags from posts. I loaded an unpublished post and used the app to publish it. Even though it shows the brackets and less than and greater than signs in the editor, when publishing it removes them all, revealing the code - including WordPress brackets with potential PHP data.

It's fine. It seems unfinished sometimes. The lack of street names in the voice navigation makes it hard to use for navigation unless you have someone with you to be the navigator and tell you what the app is showing. The lack of street names also makes it unusable for navigation on my motorcycle where I depend solely on the voice prompts. To clarify, the streets were named in the app, and they even flashed across the top of the screen, they just weren't spoken in the voice prompts.
---
The OSM based app anyone can use search for smaller towns and villagesl (names that also appear as street names) isn't possible as the street come first. Can't change map layers eg cycle view. Can't change colours eg in UK motorways should be blue. Long distance drive directions prefer A to (faster) M roads.

Lacks Control First feature I checked out was New Post. Where are all my extra fields? I don't post a new item unless I can include special fields, include seo details and complete other plugin details. For me this app is only useful for comment moderation. Disappointing.
---
This app is very very limited in what it can do, compared to the site. Shame, considering users do most social media, photography and videography from mobile devices. There is no ability to link to other pages on the site when creating a new post, aside from manually entering the URL. Feature request: Bring up a list of links to choose from on our own site when tapping the link option.

Really great and helpful app, I'll recommend it for anyone. I also love that it saves work automatically even if you phone shutsdown. But sometimes it gets a little annoying when you type and are all ready to post, then it publishes a previous version of your saved work - and not the latest one. But I really enjoy using it and navigating. Thank you for making my work easy, I no write from the train, the bus, I don't have to carry a laptop around everytime

This asp is awesome. Just used it in Asia for the first time and it was a great help. I love the fact you have all the shops, ATMs, etc. offline. But it really has issues with GPS. At first I thought it was my phone but it happens on multiple devices. Sky is clear and it searches for ever to get location. One way around it is to force close the app and reopen it but even that doesn't work sometimes. I really would give this a 5 star rating if solved in future updates. Keep up the good work

Maps are stored on internal memory by default. Even when app itself is moved to SD. There is no option in settings to change the location of maps to SD card.     App has to be open all the time during maps download. If you move to other app download stops and has to be started from the very beginning.  Maps are not downloaded in background. Leaving screen with download progress shown resets download from say 50 % to 0%, meaning you cannot use your phone during maps downloading process untill it completely finished.
---
Can't change Offline Map Location (Phone Memory to Sd Card)  How can I move maps to SD? (for Android devices)     If you want to store downloaded maps on SD, you should move them directly from the app â€?open appâ€™s settings > Map > Maps storage > select SD card. If you donâ€™t see Maps storage tab in appâ€™s settings, turn off the device, take out SD card and put it back again, turn on the device. If you moved the app itself to SD, move it back to the device storage.

Surprisingly bad I didn't expect this app to be so buggy and crash-prone. It syncs and updates posts only when it wants. It almost has an (evil) mind of its own and its main purpose seems to be to annoy. If you dare to edit a post with the site admin, use unordered lists or bold and then upload it on the app, the tags appear in clear form (that is, using angle brackets). Waste of time. Fits into the new trend of beautifully designed garbage apps.
---
Trying to start a new blog and it's pretty frustrating. My images wont upload, my blog post I typed up wont upload and I'm just confused and feeling defeated. Not easy to use this app at all. I may as well just create a new site from scratch.

I need to reset app's cash each time i need to define my current location. Otherwise it shows last one it remember. BTW even after cash reset it did not navigate me by the route - the arrow just stack in the beginning of the route and that's it. Almost useless when travelling, but offline maps helps
---
Useless application, waste of money. This is useless application and waste of money. Never worked . I have Sony Xperia, Android version 4.4.2. Downloaded maps OK, but never was able to locate my device, shows only one location whatever I do, I travel to Germany and it shows me still in London!  Travel in London and rebooted device and the app multiple time, still shows the same place where I installed first time.

Good but... It is a very good app works smoothely, but lately moves my maps (in sd card) to internal memory (pretty tight in my galaxy S4) despite I indicate route to maps is sd. Once the maps are in internal memory there's no option in settings to tell app maps are in sd. Maps storage option dissappeared from setup menu... I guess this is a bug...                                                               Thanks for your reply,  it happened again,  I'll send you an email

Plenty of incorrect information, very lacking entries (it has a million hotels but none of the grocery stores), no way to report incorrect places in app, very meandering unoptimal walking suggestions and flat out incorrect public transport suggestions. It only gives you one route you cannot edit so if that bus or metro is out of commission good luck figuring out an alternative because maps.me won't help you. Edit: it is possible to add new info but not possible to report incorrect info.

"Best App of 2014"? I'd sure hate to see the worst! I'm guessing the reviewers who rated it #1 tested it exclusively in one state because this GPS app can't even cross map boundaries. If you want to go from Burbank to Las Vegas, you'll have to set up the California portion, then a separate Nevada portion. Unbelievable. Selecting a destination is an awkward process that involves manipulating the map. Sheesh! The best Android GPS I've found so far is "MapFactor GPS Navigation", which provides a variety of ways (such as Google Search) to quickly select any number of waypoints and destinations, plus traveling between states is not a problem.
---
As other reviewers have mentioned, you can't search by address. For example, if your want directions to 12335 Fake St, the app will refuse. It will only let you plot a route to Fake St. If Fake St is more than a few blocks long, that's a huge problem. Also, you can't even search for an address until you download that region's maps. If you want to drive from NYC to LA, you have to download every map along the way before you go. Problem is, most maps are named after smaller towns, not big cities.

Downloaded as it is supposed to support offline walking directions but it is rubbish. slow to load and the search can't find a metro station as a starting point to walk from, not that was a big deal as it couldn't find the destination so I guess a starting point is irrelevant. deleted I'll go back ti Google maps and use them offline even thoughbit doesn't give walking directions but at least Maps can find the start and end
---
I don't understand this app does not work at all offline... What's the point? On my Android headset every search or navigation attempt fails to find any results after downloading the whole city which took hours.   even for a city like San Francisco can't find anything unless it's connected to the internet - so why not just use Google Maps?

A significant backward step Now there is no way to select which maps to update, nor is there any indication of download size (why not?). The option to download WITHOUT routing has disappeared. I do not require routing as I already have a sat nav. Fortunately I have not updated my phone, only my tablet. I will not be updating my phone to v6 as this is the device I use most. Until now this was a 5 star app (and I had the paid version before it became free). Hugely disappointed. ------------------UPDATE. Tried updating one small map (Guernsey 449kB) and found ALL my old maps had been deleted. The new style Guernsey map is 882kB. I have backups of my old maps, so not a problem to recover them.

Not able to download Tamil Nadu, India Map. I have been using the app now for many years and it was working fine. Now I'm not able to download/update Tamil Nadu, India Map and able to download other maps. I tried all possibilities (clear storage, uninstall & reinstall, restart of phone etc. and still failing. I don't have any VPN and also I'm very close to the WIFI so no problem with that as well. As TN, India is my birth state and it is bad that I'm not able to download the map giving 1 star

It has trails in national forests and parks, too. One thing to remember before wandering somewhere new, download maps of the place, while you have wifi or cellular data. I have more than once seen a disturbing divergence between voice guidance and the blue line marking my route. Follow the blue line. The lady is a tramp. If you're a cyclist, you might not want to use this app. The route it suggested from my house to Portland,Ore would have me riding on a busy highway when plenty of country roads would have been a better experience. Google Maps is better.
---
Excruciatingly annoying Impossible to search without app insisting on downloading more maps. Deleting. Even after downloading a bunch of maps the app doesn't allow route planning. Just the boring freeways. Might as well use Waze or Google Maps. The search goes on.
---
Disappointing The big plus is the offline use of maps and the maps that look good. On the downside: we disagree on the fastest route. On first use it misses a connection to a highway and suggesting a longer route. Then the app even tries to send me back three times unnecessary, making the journey even longer. Vocal directions are ambiguous compared to my regular Garmin nav and compared to Google. Maybe it's just the dutch language. At times the GPS update seems out of sync with the actual location. Good as a backup nav.

Good . . . But . . . Update Needs more work. The app also fails to load all followed posts. Unless you open it every few hours you can look forward to missing some of the posts that you would have liked to have seen. I loaded my Reader in the app, and compared it with the browser version. In 12 hours I lost 50 posts. So. Useless if you only check once daily. Also needs better text formatting control.
---
ZERO WYSIWYG If you enjoy squinting at your screen while writing in order to distinguish you article's text from HTML code, then you'll love this app. I must ask: If Evernote & every other goofy little writing app can display bullets, bold, italic, & other formatting as I am writing, why can't this tool for professional writers do the same? I enjoy the WordPress writing experience on my PC/browser because I can engage the content & the formatting directly, organically, while I'm creating. The only time I must face HTML is for the occasional media embed, etc. But with this app the HTML codes are scattered throughout the article & act like irritating little jolts from speed bumps as the appear in the paragraph I'm working on. So it's impossible to get into a state of "flow! " C'mon, developers, you can do better than this. I would gladly pay for a WYSIWYG WordPress writing tool. Until then, it's back to my PC for writing & editing my blog posts.

Good but...... The idea is good. But it lacks dynamic routes. I mean I can't alter the route. Need more improvements. Like altering the routes. Locating my current spot on the map. And navigating from my current location. Option of travel is limited to car and walk. Why not public transport? I need continuous development. One plus to the app as it save data and I can use it despite my poor data connectivity.
---
Decent app. Tried out a few offline nav apps that use osm for data and this had the best looking map display for me. Clean and clear display during navigation a plus. Suggested nav routes were generally good, but did not care for the inability to ignore toll roads as well as to get more than one suggested route. The biggest shortcoming for me was that with just about all osm apps, the POI/address search are useless unless those items are entered in the osm database. A suggestion would be to have a online search function (like MapFactor's google search) to be able to find those items and be able to translate the info into an offline nav point. Another suggestion would be to improve the display functions during navigation, ie: speedometer/speeding warnings, lane assist, and fixed speed cameras. Needs improvements but a solid app overall.
