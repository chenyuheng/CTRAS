this app is an absolute rubbish.

While I believe this app may provide significant component for bringing some order to the chaos between my ears, there are some issue which are inhibiting and irritating.

Nonetheless, I do think this app has great potential and possibility and commend the developer(s) for offering such a rich version as a free app.
-----end of report 1096

Now the place in Settings to tell the app where to store the maps is gone.

Suggest you hire some UI designers and product managers to do a better job redesigning this app, to be user friendly and make it easy for users to do simple things, like actually entering in an address!

Based on this rather GLARING defect, I think this largely makes this app unusable for general purpose navigation..

And when visiting someone's blog, I prefer seeing an outline of their posts, which can help me access ANY post of that person, over an incomplete list of posts sorted chronically which doesn't display all of their posts (some of them are only accessible on the app through browser, so what's the point of using the app over browser?)

I wasn't told at sign up time that the app will no longer be free after 6 or 7 months or so.

I should have chosen to use Google Keep which came naturally installed app on my phone but I didn't like that everything was based on Google, also same thing with my photos, non-existent music player and some other stuff we're based on Google too meaning no gallery app (blue and yellow flower icon) and had to download VLC as a music player making me feel like I was lacking basic essentials from my phone apps.

However the real problem is that I am unable to create anything but short routes due to the limitations in the amount of stops that I can add; given there are tons of forest roads you can never pick the one you like and make something longer than 30km of a route; It also isn't even a paid feature, I'd have paid for such feature in a heartbeat.

Here's what's lacking for me: When I'm in a lecture class that I would like to record, the record function only works if I do not use any other insertable feature such as taking a picture or drawing a diagram.

This would be more compact and efficient for phone use (in my humble opinion).
-----end of report 1958 
Another good addition would be the ability to place skitch pictures next to text (not just isolated at the top)  or instead of this have sketch integrated into evernote so i can use both at the same time.
