If a blog has comment moderation enabled, and then an administrator replies to  (and thereby approves) a comment which is "pending moderation" from within this app, the comment author will never get the reply notification email.

This is because this app appears to somehow bypass the `wp_set_comment_status` hook when administrators reply to a "pending moderation" comment within the app.
-----end of report 1263 
There is a clue that the developers know of this bug (I do see it as a bug) because, in this app, an administrator can "Reply" to comment that is pending moderation, but in the regular WP Admin interface, the button is labeled "Approve and Reply" not just "Reply."
