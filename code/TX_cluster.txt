This app is so bright it hurts. You're trying to read, write and relax, but the blank color scheme reminds me more of the sun hitting my face at 6am than of me relaxing while browsing.  This app doesn't have some sort of front page like imgur has for example, instead all we get is the "discover" feature which only promotes bland, vague and uninteresting posts with no personality. Just look at it right now! Where are the people sharing relatable stories, or video game strategies, or book or tv show reviews or something? All the posts featured there are just... unattractive, to say the least. And it's the only source of new content there is, otherwise you have to look it up manually.  There are no set categories or tags, instead you make them up and unless people type them up exactly like you did they won't see your post, which is counterintuitive and discourages finding new posts or bloggers.  People can disapprove or even edit your comments. That is twisted, discourages freedom of speech and opinion sharing and even allows people to literally put words in your mouth by changing your original comment to whatever they want.  You can't dislike posts or comments, so the voting system is pointless. You might think otherwise because Twitter and Vine have no downvotes,  but they promote discovery of new content in various ways, while WordPress does not.  The search bar doesn't work. I've tried finding my own posts with the exact same title they have and they don't appear.  All of these factors make it feel deserted and lacking of a community, and discourage new users of getting into writing or reading on WordPress. Also there used to be a eay to add a black outline to images; a necessity when the background is white.

This is my second time returning, and after a 2 year hiatus, I'm pleased to say that everything I hated about this app is still there and nothing new has really changed. It's so buggy and I can't get any help on any of the bugs I experience. Like the fact that I don't do any damage when my cron rolls over. Yea�?I get no response from the developers.  The only reason I use this app is for the sake of quests? Because everything else is so boring. But even the quests are dull. And if you're in a big party, they don't even scale it properly? There's nothing like having a quest start and then having it finish a couple hours later before you even have a chance to do anything. Not to mention it totally lacks the ability remind you of anything. All it does is nag you everyday at a set time. That's all it's capable of. Set a to do with a due date? Great but you won't get a reminder about it. Not to mention the fact that it still doesn't allow any form of offline capabilities. And they just make up excuses for why they can't have it. Which I don't buy because I've used other apps like this where I can go offline and use it. Its slow as hell.  And for forcing me to be connected to the internet it doesn't even notify me of new posts from my guilds and party.

Offline reading is a huge draw for me but I don't know if it's the android app or what but the gui is completely obtuse. Impossible to get to main menu and read my saved articles, I have scoured everywhere. All I can do is save pages to my lists but not read them. One time when I updated my install it worked but no button returns me to main menu. Pressing back exits the app. Please I've searched what in Christ's name is this?

Lost loads of features with an update a few months ago. Now the sidebar is gone, so I don't know how to view my browsing history, and while I can save pages for offline reading, I no longer have access to a list of such saved pages as I once did, while all those I had saved prior to the update seem to be gone. Terrible, awful update! Lastly, every time I get off the app and use a different one, then return to Wikipedia, I am back at the main page. So annoying.

Almost perfect... but worse than before Indeed, the offline service used to be more reliable on previous version. Several pages are not saved even though it has been asked to be. Itnis mandatory to create a "reading list" which make longer both  saving process and browsing, and if previously the "bookmark" button located at the top of the article also allowed to UNsave the article (once read for instance) it is not a pain in the ... to delete a page.   Please consider giving back this button its complete and efficient ability. It would be perfect

recent update ruined the reading list and the app can no longer save pages.. when offline all pages disappear yet I saved them even my old saved pages all disappeared. That is my best feature on this app because I normally used it offline since I don't access wireless all day so please restore the original version, it was better.

Navigation is available only from your current location, you cant set another starting point for a route there is - NO route options for a route - like in google maps.  I found one app which has this and offline maps and for moment is free which i recommend after I have spent a afternoon with install and test of famous and good rated apps like Telnav, ex Skobler, Sygic, GPS Navigation from Bzing s.r.o. ex. Be-on road which miss basic function like the one mentioned before

Decent app. Tried out a few offline nav apps that use osm for data and this had the best looking map display for me. Clean and clear display during navigation a plus. Suggested nav routes were generally good, but did not care for the inability to ignore toll roads as well as to get more than one suggested route. The biggest shortcoming for me was that with just about all osm apps, the POI/address search are useless unless those items are entered in the osm database. A suggestion would be to have a online search function (like MapFactor's google search) to be able to find those items and be able to translate the info into an offline nav point. Another suggestion would be to improve the display functions during navigation, ie: speedometer/speeding warnings, lane assist, and fixed speed cameras. Needs improvements but a solid app overall.

I wanted to like this app. I'm looking for an alternative to google maps. The routing is actually ok, although the estimated timings don't take traffic conditions into account. The offline operation is good, but there isn't really an 'online' mode. If I currently have a good connection I want to be able to search a new area without having to download the section first. But what has killed it for me is that the search is useless. There us no UK postcode search, which is what I primarily use. Searching by street name sometimes works, but often comes up empty. Conversely when there are multiple matches adding extra location details (borough, etc) doesn't narrow the search effectively. As far as i can tell it treats each term entered separately and at some point if you haven't chosen one of the matches for your first term and keep typing it switches to searching on the second term, ignoring the first. I only managed to experience the navigation by finding places on Google maps, and then matching the street pattern and zooming to find them manually in this. I gather it works better in some countries than others, so I'll probably try it again sometime, but for now I'm giving up.

Maps are stored on internal memory by default. Even when app itself is moved to SD. There is no option in settings to change the location of maps to SD card.     App has to be open all the time during maps download. If you move to other app download stops and has to be started from the very beginning.  Maps are not downloaded in background. Leaving screen with download progress shown resets download from say 50 % to 0%, meaning you cannot use your phone during maps downloading process untill it completely finished.

Update April 2017: Should have updated this review much earlier!  All my criticisms appear to have been sorted. Now my 2nd choice of navigation app (1st choice is factory installed car unit). Very much improved - use it frequently.   Ignore the following!  Laggy, search either not working or finding multiple useless results. Map downloads taking much longer than previously. I'm very disappointed that a once excellent mapping and routing app is now apparently ruined.

Can't change Offline Map Location (Phone Memory to Sd Card)  How can I move maps to SD? (for Android devices)     If you want to store downloaded maps on SD, you should move them directly from the app �?open app’s settings > Map > Maps storage > select SD card. If you don’t see Maps storage tab in app’s settings, turn off the device, take out SD card and put it back again, turn on the device. If you moved the app itself to SD, move it back to the device storage.

Needs better support on yotaphone UPDATED 2 STARS REVIEW: After using this app for a few weeks on my old phone , I bought a new yotaphone 1 solely because of the native support of this app for the e ink display. I was hoping to use the e ink display as an energy saving GPS navigator. However I was soon saddened to find out that routing is not supported on the back display, and the maps that do display on the back do not automatically update to the current location.

Background battery draining Constantly using gps thereby draining battery, on a new nexus 5x, denying location permission to the maps.me app removes the gps icon from the status bar, granting location permission instantly puts the location icon back and battery goes down very fast. Cleaning cache from recovery mode doesn't help. Only uninstall or denying gps helps. Maps.me was gradually getting worse and worse after they become free and now they reached the point of total unusability. That's sad. Gotta move on to an  alternative OSM

Downloaded as it is supposed to support offline walking directions but it is rubbish. slow to load and the search can't find a metro station as a starting point to walk from, not that was a big deal as it couldn't find the destination so I guess a starting point is irrelevant. deleted I'll go back ti Google maps and use them offline even thoughbit doesn't give walking directions but at least Maps can find the start and end

Disappointing The big plus is the offline use of maps and the maps that look good. On the downside: we disagree on the fastest route. On first use it misses a connection to a highway and suggesting a longer route. Then the app even tries to send me back three times unnecessary, making the journey even longer. Vocal directions are ambiguous compared to my regular Garmin nav and compared to Google. Maybe it's just the dutch language. At times the GPS update seems out of sync with the actual location. Good as a backup nav.

Love it with a few hicups Good app but has a few issues... 1: When updating the app I loose all my downloaded maps, why not have the app download them for me or perform an update on them. 2: After an update I loose my customised locations. 3: I want to be able to find my destination using coordinates not just names of places... 4. It seems to give prescidence to highways even if they a longer route, this isnt a good algorithm... Otherwise its a good app... I love it and use it daily.

Downloaded this app to use on a trip. It clearly said I had the offline map downloaded yet when I entered in the exact address or a category.. It said zero results found even though I knew the address was within my downloaded map. Poor experience. I reconnected with at a McDonald's and only then did the address show up. If this app requires you to have data then google maps is better.

This latest version changed my default map location from SD card to main memory, then told me I didn't have enough memory to update my maps, although this version only updates changes. I then had to download my maps again after changing the location, as it STILL doesn't recognise that I already have downloaded maps!  Just to add that I have used maps from my sdcard correctly for a few years now!  This rating only applies to the latest version which screwed up my configuration. This forced me to re download maps that are already on my sdcard, as even after changing the location back to the sdcard, the app still didn't check for the existent of valid maps in the selected location.

Yes and no I used this app during vacation in LA. I was happy with it cause there's a lot of details on the map. However... 1. The search by address in offline mode didn't work for me, don't know why... 2. It would be great if there are alternative routes to choose from. For example, avoid highway and toll way. 3. Would be great if there is an alarm when you're driving exceeding the speed limit.

It's ok. It can be frustrating to use. The directional arrow sometimes keeps turning round and round and then points to the wrong direction. Nov. 2019: I just did the maps.me update--the search function doesn't work the same way it used to before the update. I used to be able to put the number of the house or building, then the street, city, state, and the app would locate the address. That doesn't work anymore.

As other reviewers have mentioned, you can't search by address. For example, if your want directions to 12335 Fake St, the app will refuse. It will only let you plot a route to Fake St. If Fake St is more than a few blocks long, that's a huge problem. Also, you can't even search for an address until you download that region's maps. If you want to drive from NYC to LA, you have to download every map along the way before you go. Problem is, most maps are named after smaller towns, not big cities.

"Best App of 2014"? I'd sure hate to see the worst! I'm guessing the reviewers who rated it #1 tested it exclusively in one state because this GPS app can't even cross map boundaries. If you want to go from Burbank to Las Vegas, you'll have to set up the California portion, then a separate Nevada portion. Unbelievable. Selecting a destination is an awkward process that involves manipulating the map. Sheesh! The best Android GPS I've found so far is "MapFactor GPS Navigation", which provides a variety of ways (such as Google Search) to quickly select any number of waypoints and destinations, plus traveling between states is not a problem.

Still better to use a web browser Pros: Useful to quickly view a single article but that's it.   Cons: Text does not re-flow to fit screen when zoomed, No text selection. Tables do not resize to fit screen and columns off screen are lost. No way to open links separately for later reading i.e. in new tab or window. This means current article and reading position are lost when a link is selected.  Please add tabbed browsing so links can be opened in separate tabs, and reflow text. Until then it's easier to use Wikipedia in a web browser...

What happened The app was good but these recent changes have turned into something it's not. Why do I have and endless scrolling page? This isn't Facebook. And why trending articles? I didn't open up Wikipedia to read random things people have read. I do it to read the random things I want to read. Also the ongoing events section was an easy way to keep an eye on large geopolitical events. Now the page is mired in junk.

God, I love Wikipedia, but... This app is way below its potential awesomeness. When I hit the back button, one of two things happens: either I am kicked all the way back to the main page, or back to the previous article, but not where I left off. If I ever want to follow a link in an article, then navigate back to that article, I have to search for it again. How can a site as well developed as Wikipedia not have an app with a working 'back' function? And Wikipedia's only response is "Hey, we're open source, YOU edit it, users!"

Good but missing Custom Post Type support. I add CPTs into most of my sites and only being able to update blog entries is very limiting. Image handling is a bit buggy. Really good when fixing typos or creating quick posts. The earlier versions of this app were way more functional.

Doesn't post a new blog if I clear the 'uploading...' notification The new blog posting process is somehow interrupted and doesn't finish completely if I clear the 'uploading...' notification.  As a user I would assume that such a process should continue in the background.  Next, if I open the app again, it doesn't show any indication of the ongoing process which doesn't give me any kind of update (of whether the new blog got completely/half way uploaded/or cancelled).  To check this, if I manually click the 'refresh' icon on top-right corner, it gives a warning message which is really doesn't help the user what his/her action should be.

Yet to be convinced... This seems to be an interesting app, no doubt, BUT it does not work for me. Why? 1. Font size hopelessly small even for a 5.2-inch smartphone screen. Maybe on a ten-inch tablet... 2. No options for routes (fastest, shortest, easiest..). It seems to automatically opt for shortest routes, which are not always the most convenient. 3. Searches of POIs return vague names (like "Gas station" without the brand, or "Parking" without immediate street indication. 4. No voice guidance for Romanian. Uninstalled for now

It's fine. It seems unfinished sometimes. The lack of street names in the voice navigation makes it hard to use for navigation unless you have someone with you to be the navigator and tell you what the app is showing. The lack of street names also makes it unusable for navigation on my motorcycle where I depend solely on the voice prompts. To clarify, the streets were named in the app, and they even flashed across the top of the screen, they just weren't spoken in the voice prompts.

The OSM based app anyone can use search for smaller towns and villagesl (names that also appear as street names) isn't possible as the street come first. Can't change map layers eg cycle view. Can't change colours eg in UK motorways should be blue. Long distance drive directions prefer A to (faster) M roads.

Garbage!! Cannot input house numbers This trash gps app does not allow you to search by house/building numbers only by  street names. If you try to search the number with the street name you WILL NOT get results.

After installing the app it showed my location and the street name was completely wrong. I wanted to see what routes it would offer me to my father's village, but a search by the name of the village did not yield any results. Uninstalled.

Great app but have some flaws In my case, I'm using Taiwan map with Chinese interface which display was perfect, but can not search specifically to NO.(number) level. It's annoying that I can only search and navigate by street names.

Could have been better Purchase the Pro version because sometimes internet/Google Maps is not always accessible. The maps looks good at first glance, especially it has street number in the map. The most unbearable problem so far is the poor searching function: tried to find a certain address but the map can not actively find the exact location and re-center the map to the target location. Moreover, it seems that the app does not recognize the address at all and do nothing. If you can not even search an address then this maps in a sense is crippled. My cell phone is LG G3, Android 4.4.2, had already loaded with the maps used for address searching.
-----end of report 109 MASTER
Only good if you know the place you are going to. Offline maps work only in the way that it gives a map for around your location while offline. If you need to find a particular street number forget it, best it can do is tell you the cnr of x and y. For roads that are 20-30km long it is worthless for navigating to a particular street address. I have to whip out google maps to get that last 1km or so. The addresses work best when you put them in backwards, even when you select the search on map option in search. It's just a mess. I really wanted to like this app. I wanted to love it.

Pictures don't display when clicked on and... The inability to keep multiple tabs open drives me nuts. I'm a college student and this app is terrible if you're using Wiki to research. God help you if you go to another article from one page- when you hit the back button, you start at the top of the first article ALL OVER AGAIN! Not saving my place in the article, especially if it's a long one or you don't remember exactly where you stopped reading is a nightmare! I love Wiki, but I  don't love this app.

They had it. then they released an update that ruined it. then they fixed again. now they ruined it again. whenever I try to go back a page to a previous article I was reading, it instead kicks me to the front page, and I have to go through my history to get back to the article I wanted. this is clunky and annoying. I will improve my rating if and when this is fixed

Doesn't open from google search - Note 3 Kitkat Searching via Google (at least through mobile Chrome) will bring up a result which you can open directly into the app, which is awesome. Except it only brings up a blank page and error, not the article. Sent in support ticket, never heard back. When they fix, I'll change to five star.

Hmmm... I'm sticking with the mobile website.  When you press the Android "back" button in this app, it reloads the previous page from scratch (placing you at the top of the page), rather than remembering your place (and open sub-topics) on the previous page.  This makes it very annoying to follow links and then try to go back to what you were reading earlier.

Improvement made it much worse. The "random page" link is my favorite part of Wikipedia - it's gone, along with most of the menu capabilities of the browser-based version. The news feed card on the main page hasn't updated in over two weeks. No way to clear the cache in-app. No way to restore main page cards accidentally deleted. No user help file in the app.

We should be grateful to be living in these times. Two decades�?ago, we had to go to a library for an encyclopaedia or buy one. Today, encyclopaedia is synonymous with user-updated real-time information -Wikipedia. Bookmarks offline feature is very helpful. The format, the dark mode, the panning of the main image are great. However, in dark mode, the quote block is poorly visible because the fonts are in grey and background is in white. Please review it. Example: Robinson Crusoe page. Also please improve your Windows 10 app so that tabs can sync across devices.

Useful, but needs work Hats off to the dev team ... this app is easy to use and does its job. A major problem, though, with the Ireland maps (at least), was that route lines overlaid the street and highway names. So, we could use this app only as an advisory to a physical map, where we could see actual street and highway names. Google Maps solves this problem by putting the route lines over the streets but under the street names. Overall, close but no cigar ... hoping for improvement in the future!
-----end of report 123 MASTER
I installed the map again on Feb 2020 in Toronto. All the street names are blacked out. Map in unusable. I deleted it. May try again when problem is resolved. Map is accurate but too simple interface. Lacks basic functionality. Can not have alternate route, choose b/w toll and free route, save route.

The update buried the feature I use most in the app This app was great until the last update. The part of the app that I used the most was the admin page access. It was always the first thing I looked at whenever I opened up the app.     I maintain several WP sites for myself, both business and personal. I use the app for when I don't want or have time to sit down at my pc to do updates.      Where I thought the app shined was maintaining my WP sites. The app allowed me to be able to easily cycle through all my sites quickly to see if they needed plugin or WP updates. After selecting the admin option, I could click each site and within minutes have all the sites updated, significantly quicker than using a pc to do it.    With the latest update to the app, the developers buried the admin page access 3 clicks deep, so what would take me 1 click + a click per site to check update status, now requires me to click into the settings, then 2 clicks per site to check for update status.    I considered this app a 5 star app before this bizarre change. I'm hoping it was an oversite or test on the developers part and that they'll fix this in the next update.  Otherwise, at least in my opinion, they've partially crippled the app.

It would be nice to see the pictures when editing a post. Each time when I  edit a post I can only see the link of the pictures which is not useful  when you want to comment them... All the rest of the app is very well made  apart this. I'm still waiting for this upgrade before using it ;-) Update :  finally they made it :-) I have installed this app many times and each time  I'd expect to sea the pictures when editing. Last time I hope might be more  than a year ago and now it's working :-) cool! Thanks WordPress :-) Next  expectation: searching a post. I've got a 1000 of them and would like to  check again all the content I've written from the beginning but it seems  that I have to slide down the page for ever to be able to reach my first  post... Am I mistaken?

The best way I can describe this app is claustrophobic. You have these massive top and bottom bars that are constantly moving in and out while browsing an article. I don't always need to have all of these options available to me, just put them back in the side bar or make an unabtrusive floating action button.

The app was incredible at one point, but now it has some SERIOUS navigational issues that have rendered it basically broken. The back button no longer works properly, as it immediately takes you back to the featured article rather than the previous page. Getting to the actual home screen of the app is much more difficult than getting to the featured article. Articles will open over previous tabs, rather than opening a new tab. Portals are also essentially broken within the app. Please fix these!

Unusable I can't leave the home page. Search shows me article titles, but tapping does nothing. Links into the app open on the home screen. If I can't read articles, it's useless.

The mobile website is more functional than the app but some of the app's features are pretty cool. I think it should go to the main page on open and have stuff like random article's on a separate page. Also, some of the page CSS was not rendered but instead displayed as text.

Needs improving Being able to save a page for offline reading is great BUT why does it all of a sudden tell me I have no Internet connection when I am in the middle of reading an article? It does this often when I am on the train, so it forces me to do extra step of saving page, just in case my connection might go off while I am reading article. Also when I am on an article page, press home and then open app again a couple of minutes later, I expect to be on article page, not back on home page.

Wow, what has happened to this app. It used to be so good and extremely user-friendly.  Even after downloading a number of maps it still can't find it's arse with it's own hand. Not impressed with the new version. I have increased my opinion by one star because the Maps Me guys responded to my problems and really made an effort to sort out my issues. I feel there are still issues to be fixed so will see if this can again be a 5 star app. One issue is if you select a landmark without a direct road access then try to get a routing it doesn't work.  You have to select a road outside the landmark, what?? Secondly when doing search for somewhere like Xi'an China if you forget the apostrophe Xian City  itself does not appear, just 300 hotels etc in Xian that spell it without the apostrophe. Minor bug but still a pain if you don't know the exact spelling. Will still use it, but before I never considered using anything else,  now will keep my eye out for something better. Doubt it but you never know.

I have been using this app for several years. It was very good but has become less reliable as time has passed. I was beginning to think it was my phone developing a problem but I know have a new one and there are still fundamental issues. It can't find my home street or several major roads in London ( eg Holloway Road, Oxford Street) and regularly fails to get a route due to application errors, dumping me off the coast of Africa. Tried deleting and reloading but no better. Time to try other apps

The app is pretty handcuffed when compared with the web editor. The app lacks easy linking to already published posts, a way to copy a previous post, and the mouse support on Android is terrible - formatting buttons and most dialog boxes don't respond to mouse clicks at all. Basic interaction with the admin side, such as comment moderation and stats are fine, but for actually creating and publishing content, the app is very much a second class citizen compared to the web editor. Full integration of the web editor capabilities would make for a much better experience.

Always crashes on the 1st try. I'm gonna uninstall this for awhile and come back to it later. The app isn't very functional, and looks no better than the web page. Couple that with constant crashes, and I would say its not worth it on 4.4 devices.

Used to be the best map. Great features, easy to use, but it has ONE MAJOR BUG that has been there for 2 years - they sometimes solve it, most of the time they mess it up.  It is a very simple thing : the option to save maps to SD CARD.  Sometimes an update would relocate your maps to the phone, sometimes it would delete all maps, sometimes you had to uninstall and reinstall, sometimes ....  This time they have surpassed it : it moved all my SD CARD maps to memory, filling it right up!! And today there is no option to locate maps to SD CARD any more.  2 years and they still can't get this simple but ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL feature to hold.  So, finally, I'm done and, guess what, in doing so, after trying 8 apps I have found an even better one :  HERE MAPS.

I've been using this app for car and pedestrian navigation for years, but this latest version is simply useless for car navigation. I just got back from a weekend car trip in the Netherlands, using the app for each segment to navigate. About 20 (!) times in 2 days the map display would simply freeze. Sometimes for a minute, or 2, or 5, sometimes it just hung and you had to kill the app and restart it. The voice announcements still worked (as did the speed indicator), but since this app's turn-by-turn instructions are often ambiguous and sometimes just plain wrong, you can't rely on them, so having a frozen map is really the worst thing for navigation. We lost quite a bit of time around Arnhem, Oosterbeek, Nijmegen, etc. having to stop at the side of the road to restart the navigation. And that wasn't just on my phone, we also used the app in parallel on my wife's phone and it hung at *exactly* the same places. So the current version would really get only one star for car navigation.

This latest version no longer lets me share an article from a web browser into a new post. It always gives me a blank post where, before, it set the post title to the article title and placed a link to the article in the body of the post. This app is pretty useless to me until it's fixed.
