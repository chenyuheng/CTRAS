Need some sort of an update for this app.
-----end of report 1 
Bugs, Bugs, Bugs in the Latest Update This app worked great and loved the material design update a couple weeks ago.
-----end of report 102 
Updating posts on tablets and phones has been great with the WordPress app and I feel it's just been made more difficult with this update.
-----end of report 163 
And following an app update, you then MUST re-download ALL previously downloaded apps, and again, fill up the phone storage not the SD.
-----end of report 170 
This app was the best app on my device since last 30 months uptil last update in Dec. 18.
-----end of report 196 
Updated Dec 2017: crashes repeatedly all day long since app update end of Nov on Samsung s8.
-----end of report 312 
The recent update (v 10.4.4 build 458403 public; Editor: v112.1.14477; Service: v1.23.6) completely ruined what used to be a great app.
-----end of report 377 
I'm not sure if they fixed it on purpose or by mistake, but I'm not going to take any chances updating the app again after this in case the next update brings back the lag again.
-----end of report 53 
With the latest update to the app, the developers buried the admin page access 3 clicks deep, so what would take me 1 click + a click per site to check update status, now requires me to click into the settings, then 2 clicks per site to check for update status.
-----end of report 563 
(NB the Windows 10 app update doesn't even appear to have the option to change the sync setting at all - in fact the settings menu seems to have disappeared completely!!!)
-----end of report 57 
This app doesn't allow you to link to your own earlier posts, crashes often, can sometimes delet your whole draft even unsave a previously update and saved page, and has issues previewing images.

New Upgrade = Loss of Functionality Evernote automatically updated on 9/4/14.
-----end of report 14 
Absolutely appalled - had to clear the data and cache associated with the gallery and restart phone - have deleted Evernote and won't be using it no matter how useful it could be.
-----end of report 182 
Did that, except in Settings, there was no "Support" button, thus, no "Send Activity Log"  And, here I am paying for the "Premium" feature of Evernote.
-----end of report 2 
I can forgive almost all the other quirks except the fact that when I type a word (and Evernote causes my keyboard to get it wrong) and I backspace, it doesn't delete the entire word, and I have to go thru and delete the entire word manually, no matter what long, nonsensical word Evernote has decided to put in for me.
-----end of report 210 
2015 Update - Evernote has officially jumped the shark by removing key offline functionality for free users.
-----end of report 23 
Even working with Evernote tech support (who spent a lot of time assisting me) the problem couldn't be resolved.
-----end of report 248 
Last of all, please stop pushing Evernote ads into my device's notification menu.
-----end of report 290 
Updated Feb 2020: what is wrong with Evernote?
-----end of report 310 
Evernote has completely lost my trust - how can you not keep a local cache of data, and not even show an error message when the sync fails?!
-----end of report 337 
After multiple updated over the years, Evernote definitely is a lot more polished and feature rich than it used to be.
-----end of report 340 
I really want to completely leave Keep for Evernote however the lack of this feature may be a deal breaker for me.
-----end of report 343 
This feature actually is extremely useful and Evernote keeps it rather simple.
-----end of report 375 
Story goes like this: Almost all the working days I used to add important information in Evernote.
-----end of report 425 
When I try to add the Evernote List widget it gives me the following error "Problem loading widget".
-----end of report 443 
Decided to try Evernote using the Springpad export feature (Evernote waived the file size limit for this changeover).
-----end of report 484 
Mainly this is due to crazy formatting when clipping a webpage from chrome (menu -> share -> add to Evernote), or even just copy and paste, as 'paste plain text' pastes with exactly the same formatting as the standard paste option.
-----end of report 493 
In addition, I've found out that trying to privately inform Evernote of a bug that is causing me to stop using their product is a paid feature.
-----end of report 568 
I am writing this review because when I wanted to contact the support team , there is no option unless i "UPGRADE" meaning i have to pay money just to "TALK TO THEM"  I am writing here to tell you that I have been using your Evernote App for many many years now.

Having said that, the tablet version of Evernote is a very poor excuse of an attempt to create something that works.
-----end of report 3 
At the moment I'm getting by with the web version of Evernote when I'm using my Pixelbook but I really don't want to be

Even after uninstalling the Metro version with a registry clean, the legacy version refused to install claiming only one version was allowed per user.
-----end of report 247 
It says it's due to too many devices connected and to upgrade to the pro version, I have and only ever have had one device connected which it shows in the settings.
-----end of report 266 
**I do not recommend a buy on this app' but stick with the free version as the  major difference is the ability to search on this one, but it is not good and you essentially have the same features on both, free & Pro, with out it.
-----end of report 315 
One step forwards, two steps backwards (UPDATE#2)   Material design is in the right direction, BUT The overlap text bug that was fixed in the previous version IS BACK.
-----end of report 5 
============ end of one review of ONSF, group_count: 4, total_review_count: 36
Another bug exists when trying to change the font characteristics of any text you have already typed into the note.
-----end of report 109 
It used to be that if I tapped that icon, it would search within that note, finding the key text right then and there, highlighting it.
-----end of report 111 
Train stations are well-marked and it's pretty easy to follow along with your reason trip to know how much further you need to go and where to get off (note that the routing itself i s by driving rather than public transport, which would have been a nice feature, but that you can simply see where the tracks are).
-----end of report 141 
But now from last two updates Evernote has disappointed me again and again because whenever I share and save a note, it's(note's) view is totally compromised.
-----end of report 155 
Tonnes of fluff, but lacks some basic stuff... ... like the ability to delete a note, which has been requested for a bloody long time.
-----end of report 173 
The rich text formatting also occasionally bugs out completely, especially on a note with lots of formatting, and sometimes the only way to fix it is to remove the formatting and add it all back manually.
-----end of report 177 
And why do you have to perform 2 steps to get note to appear on homescreen?
-----end of report 223 
Used to be able to set reminder from inside note when creating note.
-----end of report 224 
Use to be if u typed something in ur note & used the back button, it would save whatever u wrote AUTOMATICALLY & BEFORE going back to the main menu.
-----end of report 229 
If I do find what I'm looking for, I can't edit at that location, as soon as I hit the edit button (why you'd need a button to edit a note when thats basically all this program is for is beyond me), it takes me back to the top of the note.
-----end of report 257 
Is there a way to disable these features and what logic is behind you needing access to my contact and call log information for making note taking easier?
-----end of report 264 
In Edit Note I need these Options , Kindly solve my issue 😠 When I save a txt note and then I try to edit it , the font change its color to white and get disappeared , then no matter what to do but the Note get clear.

I need these option in editing a note the most important option is❕Simply Formatting.

Still freezes, note reopens while reading, crashes.
-----end of report 311 
The quick note option in the notification bar is not appearing for me.
-----end of report 46 
The problems are mostly small but constant, like how evernote will randomly remove some spaces when I try to edit the note in android.
-----end of report 510 
Half the options for adding a note are at ant given time not even an option.
-----end of report 596 
When I save the note, I can see the image fine, but now I am unable to edit the note properly because it tells me that the "format is not supported".

DO NOT engage the user outside of the app unless it is for a currently requested function or feature they are actively using, such as continuing navigation while in the background.
-----end of report 116 
I used to give this app 5 stars but recent years' updates have rendered it almost useless for me.
-----end of report 126 
Reduction of performance Useful app plus web tutorials are great however, it is slow, to do lists are clumsy and do not allow for removing completed tasks easily.
-----end of report 131 
The load time for a list is "unbearably" long (two seconds may seem like nothing but cumulatively from opening app everytime you switch screens whether loading a 1 line list, saving, or just pressing back).
-----end of report 136 
Updated review: I have used this app for half a year, against my better judgement.
-----end of report 142 
Now I'm searching for another app which can save my data as it is available like the previous versions of Evernote used to do.
-----end of report 156 
Each time the app is updated, it decides to fill up the internal phone storage, rather than the the SD card.
-----end of report 169 
It shows up as installed in my app settings, but evernote's icon is no where to be found nor is there a widget like before.
-----end of report 172 
How dare an app be set up to arbitarily change settings on other apps without informing the user and giving them the choice not to do it!
-----end of report 183 
Seems like it would be great, but it's a bit clunky & makes my phone freeze I was really excited about this app, I wish it worked better on my phone (Moto X 2nd Gen/ And.
-----end of report 187 
Update February 2020: app still isn't working correctly even after reinstalling again.
-----end of report 200 
great features BUT ... i love the features (great widget, compatibility with Skitch etc) - they're great for my Note II, and make for a great SNote (app) replacement  BUT - there are some issues.
-----end of report 202 
I tried send a file from (Google keep) to evernote, every file if content : yahoo or Google and login or password these kind of words, will be changed to yahoo online news or advertising in my evernote , it's really make me worry about this app it's safe to save my files ??!!
-----end of report 218 
The most frustrating feature missing for me right now is the ability to change the default view in the computer based app, it always defaults to "Created" (date) and "Revers Sort Order", I do not think that way; I need to specify my preferred view ("Notes by Title" Ascending).
-----end of report 220 
I have used this app from the beginning, and I have been through all the bugs and fixes.
-----end of report 226 
And when visiting someone's blog, I prefer seeing an outline of their posts, which can help me access ANY post of that person, over an incomplete list of posts sorted chronically which doesn't display all of their posts (some of them are only accessible on the app through browser, so what's the point of using the app over browser?)
-----end of report 236 
I should have chosen to use Google Keep which came naturally installed app on my phone but I didn't like that everything was based on Google, also same thing with my photos, non-existent music player and some other stuff we're based on Google too meaning no gallery app (blue and yellow flower icon) and had to download VLC as a music player making me feel like I was lacking basic essentials from my phone apps.
-----end of report 243 
I wish it could just do a small box over the existing screen, where you could select your options like tags and notebook, without changing the active app.
-----end of report 244 
I rely on this app for everything and now I can't use it for its most important feature to me!
-----end of report 249 
2-You cannot get the edit post link through the app, have to log into dashboard on a browser.
-----end of report 269 
------------- Next I uninstalled & re-installed the app (for the 12th time trying to fix the vanishing maps problem).
-----end of report 27 
Google Play Services has Stopped Every time I open this app, my Note 4 heats up and lags until I get a message saying Google play services has crashed.

Great app based on features, AWFUL due to bugs!

(for Android devices)     If you want to store downloaded maps on SD, you should move them directly from the app – open app’s settings > Map > Maps storage > select SD card.

Continuous upsell of "Upgrade you subscription" type messages in push notification and in-app promos daily are starting to really bug me.

Missing key features Been using this app for a few years and it is still lacking two significant features:  1.
-----end of report 351 
Then when you go back into the app to see what is going on it deletes the post you were trying to upload and you are left with only the title and the knowledge that you have entirely wasted your time and need to write the whole thing and locate all the media files again.

New Device Limit Feedback If you're going to lock us out of a 3rd device, which may be our Mobile App, at least give us access to Manage Devices in the mobile app!

too many updates and some minor annoyances good solid app,  but too many updates all the time.
-----end of report 418 
it uses data and slow the app in place with slow internet.
-----end of report 440 
needs an option to sync every week, more like offline app.
-----end of report 441 
The app lacks easy linking to already published posts, a way to copy a previous post, and the mouse support on Android is terrible - formatting buttons and most dialog boxes don't respond to mouse clicks at all.
-----end of report 447 
The app updated older versions of post drafts so that the recent progress was deleted.
-----end of report 472 
Very unstable on Asus Tablet Adding photos via the camera very often crashes the app, which then of course loses everything you've written.

I have been using this app for several years in classes, starting on the first generation Asus Transformer, and there really hasn't been any changes or updates made since then.
-----end of report 543 
It's overbloated with useless features (chat, connect to FB, Twitter...) but it is missing important features - export to PDF and share (in normal way like every other app do)...
-----end of report 544 
The more functions get added the less I like using the app.
-----end of report 553 
I don't want to have to remove the sync setting as I do want the app to sync regularly when I'm online.
-----end of report 56 
The app allowed me to be able to easily cycle through all my sites quickly to see if they needed plugin or WP updates.
-----end of report 561 
Updates have ruined this app The sharing option has been turned into a mess.
-----end of report 566 
And while I like to be encouraged to switch to a subscription by extra features, but forcing your customers to pay up by removing the core functionality of the app (ability to synchronize across more than 2 devices) is a very ugly business practice.
