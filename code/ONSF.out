Need some sort of an update for this app.

Kept this app on one phone in meantime in case later updates solve the storage problems, but unlikely as it is policy.

Each time the app is updated, it decides to fill up the internal phone storage, rather than the the SD card.
-----end of report 169 
And following an app update, you then MUST re-download ALL previously downloaded apps, and again, fill up the phone storage not the SD.
-----end of report 170 
This app was the best app on my device since last 30 months uptil last update in Dec. 18.

Previous version (on my Android phone) wouldn't let me access my Notifications, so I just updated the app, hoping this would help.
-----end of report 450 
You'd assume such a massively popular and old app that gets frequent updates would have had bugs like these fixed years ago...

I'm not sure if they fixed it on purpose or by mistake, but I'm not going to take any chances updating the app again after this in case the next update brings back the lag again.
-----end of report 53 
The app allowed me to be able to easily cycle through all my sites quickly to see if they needed plugin or WP updates.
-----end of report 561 
With the latest update to the app, the developers buried the admin page access 3 clicks deep, so what would take me 1 click + a click per site to check update status, now requires me to click into the settings, then 2 clicks per site to check for update status.

Did that, except in Settings, there was no "Support" button, thus, no "Send Activity Log"  And, here I am paying for the "Premium" feature of Evernote.
-----end of report 2 
I can forgive almost all the other quirks except the fact that when I type a word (and Evernote causes my keyboard to get it wrong) and I backspace, it doesn't delete the entire word, and I have to go thru and delete the entire word manually, no matter what long, nonsensical word Evernote has decided to put in for me.

So hears my review While sharing something to evernote, I have to click this and then that just to select which notebook I want to save it to otherwise it automatically saves into the wrong notebook.

I tried downloading evernote on my computer but can't start it (just in the browser, and can't play the audio files there anyway) and just encountered more useless problems that I have no idea how to fix...

Last of all, please stop pushing Evernote ads into my device's notification menu.

Evernote has completely lost my trust - how can you not keep a local cache of data, and not even show an error message when the sync fails?!
-----end of report 337 
I really want to completely leave Keep for Evernote however the lack of this feature may be a deal breaker for me.
-----end of report 343 
Please provide a restricted version with fewer permissions "Evernote Private", without the privacy issues and albeit, less functionality.
-----end of report 424 
When I try to add the Evernote List widget it gives me the following error "Problem loading widget".
-----end of report 443 
my problem is that evernote overrides/bugs out the native spell checker which results in the autoreplace preventing me from typing because EVERY SINGLE KEYSTROKE results in a word injection.

Even working with Evernote tech support (who spent a lot of time assisting me) the problem couldn't be resolved.

Suffice to say that just before I started typing this, I fired a message from a reserve Evernote account (opened solely for this purpose) to the main one via Work Chat.
-----end of report 253 
Having said that, the tablet version of Evernote is a very poor excuse of an attempt to create something that works.

This time (June 5 update) a synching error message keeps on appearing, upon which the app suggests to "see the original note".

Inability to load notes when there is no internet connection if they had been updated (and there is no setting to turn on local storage) makes the app completely unreliable.

I also like the fact that you can download the app to any device and log in and change or edit your note in real time!
-----end of report 407 
The app does not allow to do basic things like deleting folders, bulk action on notes, it syncs slowly, the basic function of tap-to-edit so common in ALL the other note taking apps is missing.

No Android Love I like evernote wanted to love it,but compared to windows and mac version it doesn't compare, give android users some love, let us change the view setting, give us the same tool options, and it would be nice if there was a spell check and color coding options on the tags or notebooks, why are you guys so afraid of  color!
-----end of report 438 
Mainly this is due to crazy formatting when clipping a webpage from chrome (menu -> share -> add to Evernote), or even just copy and paste, as 'paste plain text' pastes with exactly the same formatting as the standard paste option.
