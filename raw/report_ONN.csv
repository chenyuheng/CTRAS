Really sucks when you are out and about and have to write everything down on paper and wait until you get back to the office.  Sucks again.  Need some sort of an update for this app.  (Android)  Got an email from Evernote:  1.  Open Evernote 2.  Tap on the three dots in the upper right corner. 3.  Click on ""Settings,"" ""Support,"" ""Send Activity Logs."" Did that, except in Settings, there was no ""Support"" button, thus, no ""Send Activity Log""  And, here I am paying for the ""Premium"" feature of Evernote.  So, looking for an alternative with ""support"" I downloaded Microsoft One Note.  Don't like it as much, but it is new and at least I can edit the app information.  And, they have constant updates. So, guess what?  I am slowly but surely transitioning from Evernote over to One Note.  Well, there doesn't seem to be an additional review so I will add to this one.  First, I praise Evernote for their PC version of this program.  Having said that, the tablet version of Evernote is a very poor excuse of an attempt to create something that works.  You can read the info that you have stored but that is about it.  I have found another program that works, and works well.  So after having written this note, I am forthwith deleting the Tablet version of Evernote from this tablet.  This goes with an admonition to read all the review of this app program prior to downloading it to your phone or tablet.  PS:  There is absolutely no credible support from Evernote for this app."

Saving the image on the device, and then attaching it to Evernote is fine, but is so much less efficient.

You're trying to read, write and relax, but the blank color scheme reminds me more of the sun hitting my face at 6am than of me relaxing while browsing.  This app doesn't have some sort of front page like imgur has for example, instead all we get is the ""discover"" feature which only promotes bland, vague and uninteresting posts with no personality. Just look at it right now! Where are the people sharing relatable stories, or video game strategies, or book or tv show reviews or something? All the posts featured there are just... unattractive, to say the least. And it's the only source of new content there is, otherwise you have to look it up manually.  There are no set categories or tags, instead you make them up and unless people type them up exactly like you did they won't see your post, which is counterintuitive and discourages finding new posts or bloggers.  People can disapprove or even edit your comments. That is twisted, discourages freedom of speech and opinion sharing and even allows people to literally put words in your mouth by changing your original comment to whatever they want.  You can't dislike posts or comments, so the voting system is pointless. You might think otherwise because Twitter and Vine have no downvotes,  but they promote discovery of new content in various ways, while WordPress does not.  The search bar doesn't work. I've tried finding my own posts with the exact same title they have and they don't appear.  All of these factors make it feel deserted and lacking of a community, and discourage new users of getting into writing or reading on WordPress.

The only way to see this info is to sort by ""Date Created"" or ""Recently Update"" which is totally useless for me. Would not have ""upgraded"" if I would have known about this.  Also, why can't the sort be set differently if you are on Notebook vs. Tag vs. All Notes? E.G. when I select notebooks, sort by title but when I switch to tags, sort by notebook?

There is absolutely no way of cancelling out without uploading/saving it, so this POS app saved this version of my note, completely overwriting and eliminating all the additional info I had worked so hard to create.  what's even WORSE!!...

This had been an issue with the Android client for years and recently started plaguing the Windows app. Words and letters often jump around randomly while trying to edit lists and checkboxes, or during copy and paste. Sometimes entire sentences disappear or move to the top or bottom line, with word order jumbled up. Years ago I used the app every day, but now I actively avoid using it as it fills me with dread. I don't know how many notes I've lost due to word corruption. Tags are used instead of folders, so there's absolutely no separation between work or personal notes. Individual notes can be attached to a particular notebook, but this approach fails because the search system is broken. Search occasionally displays results from EVERY note instead of only a specified notebook. I don't want to find word colleagues' information mixed in with my personal notes, but Evernote thinks it's OK. At the moment it is almost unusable for people with multiple projects all happening at the same time. Tags are useless. Nobody in their right mind mixes all their client notes with their personal notes in filing cabinets, so why does Evernote assume it's acceptable? For consulting jobs it would be nice to be able to separate each client into their own folder so there is no accidental overlap, but this is not possible with Evernote, so it remains a gimmick for me. I'm slowly training myself to use OneNote because Evernote is becoming unusable due to the unresolved bugs."

The notebooks aren't color-coded and I wish they appeare in tabs like in OneNote. There is no options to view the pages other than scrolling vertically. The recordings are at the end of the page so I have to scroll forever in big notebook. The handwriting is a huge pain, pdf notation is quite confusing and doesn't work on my tablet or phone.

Evernote is now useless when data is not available: during oversees travel, as a frequent flyer, subway commutes, urban/underground settings (office, gym, shopping, etc).  In this day and age of FREE, full functionality organizational apps like OneNote (font changes, sketching capabilities, email to app, etc), I don't see a reason to continue using Evernote.

There's no option to save here, and the *affirmative* choice *deletes* my edits (jeez, if you're not paying attention...). Other apps either automatically save (which I would prefer in Evernote, and it does this for *new* notes), or ask if I want to save--not discard--the changes. Nope, in Evernote I have to reach up to the top left corner of the screen and tap the checkmark to save. Another annoyance is having to tap the edit button and then tap the text to edit a note. In other apps, simply tapping the text is sufficient to bring up the keyboard.

That being said, this app has much better support for Andoird however the support for Chromebook is so-so. The app relies on your device's keyboard autocorrect features, which is great....for phones. My chromebook has a physical keyboard and thus doesn't have autocorrect built in. It is annoying to be reading through my notes and having to also spell check everything at the same time. The drawing feature is basic, but okay. After clicking the drawing icon it opens up a new page for your drawings, and once finished will simply ""paste"" the entire large picture under your notes. It would be nice if I could just annotate my notes and draw small diagrams next to, or between, paragraphs of text notes. I assume this is related to the lack of Chromebook support as that would be difficult to accomplish on a phone. You have the ability to add in photos from your gallery or dowloads into notes, which is awesome in addition to my Chromebooks ""snippet"" feature, however you can NOT resize the image from within the app. You must open the image seperately, edit the sizing of the photo (guessing on how it will fit in your notes) and then REIMPORT the image to the notes. This is annoying and frustrating. All in all, this app is not bad and gets the job I need done better than Microsoft (on android) but lacks support for Chromebook.

I mean that I just want a /read only/ feature. So you can read your whole text without being able to edit it. It is so easy to accidently tap on the screen and the keyboard appears. Then by mistakes it edits a single character and my list of newly edited notes is wrong. It would be nice also to have a shortcut to copy the entire text without having to go to edition mode. This is my number one problem that makes me lose a lot of time and sometimes by doing this it accidentally edits my text so I need to fix it. I often type on my computer so I can after that send the text on my phone, since writing on computer is faster and easier. Which is why.

Some advice: ●Make the quests you  can buy with gold cheaper. 200 coins takes forever to grind and there's not  much to do otherwise. ● Have a way for f2p players to earn crystals (maybe  through daily login bonuses, level up bonuses or grind and buy them with  gold). ●Offline capabilities especially for checklists and tasks. I  shouldn't need the internet to check off my to do list. ●Have the ability  to choose your class at the start and allow players to change class  whenever they'd like. Having to wait until you're level 10 is too much of a  grind. ●Have a little more customization available from the start (maybe a  freeby starter egg or a background or outfit).

Moving tasks up and down the list doesn't work properly (lags and jitters). Tapping refresh puts them back in their original order making re-sequencing them pointless. Which brings me to another point: refresh has to be tapped constantly to see changes that you make. I created a habit and it seemingly disappeared right after hitting save and wouldn't appear until I refreshed. Also, how do I hear the theme song? I can change it in the settings but tapping each option simply changes which one is active. How am I supposed to know which theme I want if I can't preview it? Another problem is the tutorial: tapping the menu items at the bottom didn't always activate each sections tutorial. For example, I tapped on To-do and created some items, then went to Rewards, saw that tutorial, went back to To-do, and then the app decided to display the tutorial for To-do.

But if I roll the note to it's end the circle disappear, so I need to roll in up a little bit once again. Why?! Why reinvent the wheel? You have a H-U-G-E bar at the top of the screen. Just push all control and navigation there, without useless animations. Please.   2. Typing while note editing - When you editing a note, some other circle appear at the right-bottom corner of the screen, above the keyboard, exactly at the same place where the text ends. so instead of placing the cursor an the end of my text, I'm pressing this circle (with ""A""). I use it on Note 3, so it's not like I has a tiny screen. Once again: the H_U_G_E bar at the top of the screen can successfully contain this control.

The routing is actually ok, although the estimated timings don't take traffic conditions into account. The offline operation is good, but there isn't really an 'online' mode. If I currently have a good connection I want to be able to search a new area without having to download the section first. But what has killed it for me is that the search is useless. There us no UK postcode search, which is what I primarily use. Searching by street name sometimes works, but often comes up empty. Conversely when there are multiple matches adding extra location details (borough, etc) doesn't narrow the search effectively. As far as i can tell it treats each term entered separately and at some point if you haven't chosen one of the matches for your first term and keep typing it switches to searching on the second term, ignoring the first. I only managed to experience the navigation by finding places on Google maps, and then matching the street pattern and zooming to find them manually in this.

Then I changed my phone and it all went horribly wrong. It hadn't occurred to me to log out of the account on my old phone before doing a factory reset, so when I tried to synch the new one, Evernote saw it as a fourth device. I either had to upgrade to the premium package at £45/y or disable not one but TWO devices. I was able to disable the old phone's account but that was not enough. I now have to live without it being on one of my devices, which is a right pain. Evernote is unquestionably good but it's not worth £45/y so I'm not upgrading.

However, I have discovered that the Browser implementation of Evernote is very buggy and frustrating to use.  I like the idea of being able to insert images into my notes, which Evernote allows, but the Browser version does not allow insertion of new images between existing ones.  Every image you try to insert will only go to the end of the note.  You literally have to delete the entire existing note and recreate it if you want to insert a new image.  Another bug exists when trying to change the font characteristics of any text you have already typed into the note.  The system will often not allow the change, and will keep reverting back to the old font style and size.  I have emailed their tech support about these problems, but have never received a reply or any help whatsoever.

UI poor & buggy; connectivity & state-saving bugs; unintuitive & hazy. However, still a tremendous tool with (I don't use this term lightly) life-changing potential despite! I feel as though the gamification aspect is tangential but foundational to the system design. If the user relies on the superficial static pixel-art RPG as the primary mechanic incentivizing their real-world habits, tasks & challenges, they'll plateau real fast, as there isn't much substance to the 'game' side. The social/game features (custom avatars &c.) are steeply ramped to try to drive pay-for-play schemes, so the appeal to some of a casual showoff/hangout sort of play are curtailed. Some of the user-contributed content (mostly in Challenges but also in general chatpost/Tavern) is excellent; imagine self-help style microlessons but from evidence-based and therapeutically-sound sources, as well as plenty of great personal strategic content and tips from a range of people suffering from a variety of impediments to routine/studying/self-care/productivity/etc. sharing what's worked for them. Incredible, and there's also arts exposure, bookclubbing, hobbyisting, and more being done through the system as well.

It's a nice, useful app with some gaps--I really like the basic idea and the maps themselves are accurate and occasionally have nice details (for example, airport gate numbers).  There are some major gaps in searching for foods, shopping, etc., though. Primarily this is just in not having locations. For example, in one city in Japan I did a search for food and it came up with maybe 3 or 4 places when I was aware of dozens close by.  Since it pretty quickly looks for options further away, I was getting results up to fifty miles away (in Japan, traveling fifty miles can take several hours).  It also missed the biggest shopping center in the area.  Still, it's handy for knowing where you are and had the ability to download sections of the world's you're interested in.the interface is also easy to navigate and it came up with Japanese city names easily even though I was using English letters.  Train stations are well-marked and it's pretty easy to follow along with your reason trip to know how much further you need to go and where to get off (note that the routing itself i s by driving rather than public transport, which would have been a nice feature, but that you can simply see where the tracks are)."

The only good thing that this app has going for it is the clean user interface, and a clever separation of the to-do list into three sections.  It is missing some pretty basic to-do list functionality.  The game loads slowly, and doesn't work without an internet connection.  Some of the bugs I've experienced: Reminders pop up on random days, no matter how many times I readjust their settings. Constantly having trouble connecting to the servers. Visual bugs: shows one item, but you get some other item.  Newly equipped main weapon won't show on avatar until app restarted. Progress bars for quests spaz out every time you open the page.

If I use evernote across all of my devices (the only reason I use it) it constantly happens that an older version of a note on one device will sync as the most recent version, even though that device hasn't been synced in days. I lose days of information. If I have it on my computer and I didn't close it out and my computer is in sleep mode for a weekend and I've been using it on my phone throughout the weekend and I return to the computer and wake it up, that version of the notes syncs up and screws me out of the entire weekend's worth of data and updates. What kind of idiot programming allows it to think a note that hasn't been updated in two days on one device should override a note that has been constant use on another device. And why hasn't this been issue been dealt with after lord knows how many years evernote has been going. If your data is important and you are a regular user. Look for something else. I am. I'm so fed up I could spit. While I'm at it. The formatting is a crazy person. I can change the formatting for the whole note and then I'll delete a line and the formatting for everything after that will revert back to a previous formatting. Sometimes I'll be making a list and every line will be a larger font. It's seriously like the damn thing is drunk. It doesn't matter what device I use.

No titles, no subtitles, no highlighted or important points or topics which are mentioned in site as it is. Everything is saved as just plain text. And in order to rearrange the note as it is on the site, I have to highlight what was already given on the website, which consumes my most of the time to organize the note! What happened guys?

You can tell Evernote to manually sync, but I really shouldn't have to remember.

ORIGINAL REVIEW: Used to be really great on my Samsung S7. But on my Mate 10 Pro, it was just really really hard to use. (1) If I'm not using the default font, icons just show up as random letters, I wouldn't know what I was tapping if I wasn't using it before, (2) My notes look chaotic, font sizes vary throughout the note even when everything's in default and (3) I've never had problems with my keyboard using different apps but typing in Evernote was so frustrating. It keeps overwriting stuff that I'm writing with something I've typed in the same note randomly. I delete and try to type it again and it just keeps overwriting stuff that I'm writing and I can never finish anything. So I'm finally going to replace this with OneNote which I found to have a simpler interface and easier editing options in mobile."

Backspacing then runs the risk of creating more issues if it decides to keep going crazy. This frustrates me to no end. It runs the flow of writing and thinking.

So save early and often, as if you were using a word processor from the early 90s. 3) Fixed display size. If there's a way to change the display size, I haven't found it. Happy squinting."

If you want to use Evernote for its high level features and are willing to pay for it, then you'll probably like it. However, don't expect a widget because they inexplicably removed it, to the disappointment of many of their users. And if you just want an app for quick note-taking with easily accessible and searchable notes, look elsewhere unless you plan to only use one device. The developers previously limited the basic (free) account to two devices. Fine, that's understandable, if not annoying. And you could still log in through a browser, but now a browser counts as a device, which is absurd. I assume a 1 device limitation is next. It's clearly an attempt to force people into the premium plan at $8/month, which is just too much for those of us that just want the features in the basic plan but with more than one device, and they continue to not offer a lower priced plan that many would probably adopt just to have more devices. For comparison, you can get a Microsoft 365 plan for $7/month, which gets you Office 365 and a TB of cloud storage. Oh, and by the way, there's an Evernote to OneNote importer if you're looking to make a switch. I imagine there are for other note-taking platforms as well."

The biggest shortcoming for me was that with just about all osm apps, the POI/address search are useless unless those items are entered in the osm database. A suggestion would be to have a online search function (like MapFactor's google search) to be able to find those items and be able to translate the info into an offline nav point.

However the real problem is that I am unable to create anything but short routes due to the limitations in the amount of stops that I can add; given there are tons of forest roads you can never pick the one you like and make something longer than 30km of a route; It also isn't even a paid feature, I'd have paid for such feature in a heartbeat.

Tried pushing the tab key, hoping that like windows, it would indent the selected text. NO! Instead it deletes all the selected text and puts in its place a single tab. Not what I was after but no worries, let me just undo that... wait, where's the undo button? Undo!??!? You guessed it, no undo. Notes are permanently lost.  This happened again during the meeting, I accidentally deleted a block of text with a careless click. No undo, text gone. Useful valuable notes just gone.

The pages for handwriting are intensely small and the pen width is grotesquely huge so you can't fit much. Even after the update, the pen is still oppressively huge. Also, you have to back out of handwriting to save the document so if you accidentally close the app you get to start over. Only 4 pen colors. No highlighting. No eraser size choice. Cut tool is very clumsy. S-pen and fingers have the same functions. Can't export to PDF. Can't move handwriting from one page to another.

There are a lot of management features in the PC/web version that I consider very basic.  being able to edit the raw HTML code to correct errors or carry out formatting that the 'visual' mode doesn't permit is one.   Again, this might be resolved with an external editor: edit in visual/text or in html switch.

Other than that, it's generally frustrating to take notes that require any sort of diagrams. The whole ""shape prediction"" system is highly flawed, and should be replaced with polygon drawing tools. I should not have to draw an imperfect circle, wait for the program to think, ""hey, that's circle-like, here's a circle button,"" and then when I go to press said button, a mark appears where the button was, forcing me to go back and attempt again. This will happen many, many times before it actually registers the button press, and usually by the time that has happened I've lagged behind in the notes and should have just moved on. Now that I'm using it on a Samsung Note Pro 12.2, having pen input is great, but the thinnest available line is still too thick for my tastes.

When I asked for the Walgreen pharmacy, it identified such pharmacies in distances of over 4 miles, but failed to identify the pharmacy that is less than half a mile from where I was. When I asked for restaurants, it failed to identify the 99 Restaurant two blocks away from my home, while identifying another restaurants offer the same chain, several miles away.  In my opinion, the application completely failed the test. If I were in an unfamiliar city, (which is the point of a mapping application), I need to find the nearest gas station, ATM, pharmacy, or a specific address.

I went back to the app and everything was gone"

I can log into my site much faster directly through the web than I can with the app. It's difficult to edit anything as the screen jumps around when you try to scroll. If there's a WYSIWYG editor I couldn't find it. It added formatting to a post I had started on my computer, which is funny because in the preview all the formatting is stripped. I'll stick with working directly via the web thank you."

385,com.mapswithme.maps.pro,79.98701298701299,1,0,"Beautiful maps, but lots of problems and missing critical functionality. The bad: 1) Won't map to, or even find, an address. This is a serious deficiency and rules it out as a useful tool for me. It couldn't even find the city I live in, and I was literally 2 miles from it. 2) Routing is SLOW. This makes my decade old tomtom seem speedy. 3) Route time is WILDLY inaccurate. Over 7 hrs to drive 200 miles by highway? YGBSM 4) No apparent way to get an alternate route. I couldn't even find any way to force it to go through a waypoint. (Another deal breaker for me.) 5) Since routing time is so inaccurate and lack of alternative routes, no clue whether the actual route it picks is anywhere near reasonable.   The good: 1) Really nice maps. The best I've seen. 2) Useful info on POIs including hours, phone, website, etc. is great. 3) Can use national level overview maps with cities and interstates without any download.  This would be good if all you want is pretty maps with no routing. I may keep it just so I can see where in the world I am while flying."

In that case all attachments, pictures, etc... are UNAVAILABLE.  Not fun anymore!! If only put the stuf in the paper... As much as I tried to fall in love with this app, I am now abandoning it completely.  If I buy premium account it would represent the MOST expensive piece of software (if U buy win every 5 years and use mostly opensource, Evernote is twice as much = cca 300$) When you read reviews on net - be adviced: they are mostly written by premium account users or by users with almost all time internet conection.  Evernote stuff: Please take into consideration to include offline data to free accounts, please. Notes on web are USELESS if you don't have web access!!"
387,com.evernote,79.75324675324676,1,1,"Completely Useless Now! Since the new update I can no longer read my notes if I'm offline. Now Evernote says they have taken away the most useful part of the app (that I use to have access to) and I can have it back if I pay them!  And it is a monthly fee at that, not a one time purchase.  Two issues: 1. How can they take away something I already had, and then charge for it?  2.  Why should I pay Evernote to read the notes I took all the time to make?  Its not like they put a lot of time or energy into writing these notes for me. No one makes you pay to reread your notes from a regular old notepad.   Conclusion: do not get this app unless you like to pay money to take notes. There are many other options out there."
388,com.evernote,79.75324675324676,1,7,Worst application ever. I cannot access my notes unless I upgrade. You can stop me from writing new note. But how the can you not allow me to use me existing notes. Scam they are doing. They read my card number god know from where? No privacy and no security. Like beggars asking me to validate my card details so that I can access my own notes. Never seen such beggars in my life before. Kindly do not use this app. Even if you are a paid customer kindly unsubscribe and do uninstall this scam from you phone right now.

My saved searches work fine on desktop, but not here. Interface is awful and wastes TONS of screen space. Instead of a nice condensed list of notes, only 5 notes fit on the screen at a time because of all the useless blank space. Same for tags. Hardly any customization for the view. I don't need to see the date on the note list but I don't have a choice to turn it on/off."

What some may have thought was a slick new interface, is really just a map without street names. I don't know where I'm going or how, and there's no land marks to help me. All my notes are jumbled in one space, and I have to manually go to the specific notebook I need. And taking away the widget? Honestly, nail in the coffin.

If you've scanned a business card the only way to check the information is categorised correctly is to cut the text out (to see the label) and paste it back in! Evernote used to be more productive than free business card scanning software. Now it is less. Please fix or I will cancel my premium subscription."

HOWEVER, despite all the effort I have put into the  app with adding new places, it never seems to be able to back up my saved  pins for places I like. This is very annoying as when I have changed over  phones, they don't restore along with all my other data. When I try logging  into OpenStreetMap on the app, there always says there is an error with log  in.

398,com.evernote,79.60606060606061,2,0,"Technically, I don't ""dislike,"" this app.  I actually like it quite a bit. But I'm frustrated to the point of getting rid of it.  Why?  Because the more you use it, the less useful it becomes.  How?  When you take notes at work or school, do you just throw them all into one folder called ""notes?""  No.  You organise them by subject in notebooks.  Evernote lets you do that, but it assumes that whenever you open it, you're looking for that overstuffed ""notes"" folder rather than one subject in particular.  There's NO OPTION to set Notebooks as the default view.  How has this never been addressed?  How?  It's ridiculous.  It's downright stupid.  It mocks me.  I hate it.  I'm taking it personally as a CHOICE by Evernote you waste my time.  I wonder if One Note can help me here?"

Some current bugs: 1: If you have more than 5 notes and use it on Yosemite retina forget about using Evernote, takes over 5 seconds to even copy and paste something in. Simply pressed the space bar can take over 5 seconds.  2: Cannot cut simple text out of some notes for reason's beyond me.  3: You cannot edit passworded or encrypted docs on the Android phone anymore.
