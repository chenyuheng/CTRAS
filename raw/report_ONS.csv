0,Cannot edit app.
1,Just sucks.
2,"Supposed to be able to edit, but crashes each time I hit the edit button."
3,Really sucks when you are out and about and have to write everything down on paper and wait until you get back to the office.
4,Sucks again.
5,Need some sort of an update for this app.
6,(Android)  Got an email from Evernote:  1.
7,Open Evernote 2.
8,Tap on the three dots in the upper right corner.
9,3.
10,"Click on ""Settings,"" ""Support,"" ""Send Activity Logs."""
11,"Did that, except in Settings, there was no ""Support"" button, thus, no ""Send Activity Log""  And, here I am paying for the ""Premium"" feature of Evernote."
12,"So, looking for an alternative with ""support"" I downloaded Microsoft One Note."
13,"Don't like it as much, but it is new and at least I can edit the app information."
14,"And, they have constant updates."
15,"So, guess what?"
16,I am slowly but surely transitioning from Evernote over to One Note.
17,"Well, there doesn't seem to be an additional review so I will add to this one."
18,"First, I praise Evernote for their PC version of this program."
19,"Having said that, the tablet version of Evernote is a very poor excuse of an attempt to create something that works."
20,You can read the info that you have stored but that is about it.
21,"I have found another program that works, and works well."
22,"So after having written this note, I am forthwith deleting the Tablet version of Evernote from this tablet."
23,This goes with an admonition to read all the review of this app program prior to downloading it to your phone or tablet.
24,PS:  There is absolutely no credible support from Evernote for this app.
25,"One step forwards, two steps backwards (UPDATE#2)   Material design is in the right direction, BUT The overlap text bug that was fixed in the previous version IS BACK."
26,"Also, the formatting bar is taking more space on a tablet, when it used to share the space with the top bar."
27,"Still waiting for ability to add tables, change fonts and colours."
28,"(UPDATE#1)  Another bug unfortunately is when I paste an image from Chrome, only a small pink box appears."
29,"When I save the note, I can see the image fine, but now I am unable to edit the note properly because it tells me that the ""format is not supported""."
30,Please help!
31,PS.
32,"Saving the image on the device, and then attaching it to Evernote is fine, but is so much less efficient."
33,Change also the text search highlight colour from yellow to something else because it is easily confused with the normal text highlighter!
34,"(It is orange on iOS, making it even more confusing!)"
35,This app is so bright it hurts.
36,"You're trying to read, write and relax, but the blank color scheme reminds me more of the sun hitting my face at 6am than of me relaxing while browsing."
37,"This app doesn't have some sort of front page like imgur has for example, instead all we get is the ""discover"" feature which only promotes bland, vague and uninteresting posts with no personality."
38,Just look at it right now!
39,"Where are the people sharing relatable stories, or video game strategies, or book or tv show reviews or something?"
40,"All the posts featured there are just... unattractive, to say the least."
41,"And it's the only source of new content there is, otherwise you have to look it up manually."
42,"There are no set categories or tags, instead you make them up and unless people type them up exactly like you did they won't see your post, which is counterintuitive and discourages finding new posts or bloggers."
43,People can disapprove or even edit your comments.
44,"That is twisted, discourages freedom of speech and opinion sharing and even allows people to literally put words in your mouth by changing your original comment to whatever they want."
45,"You can't dislike posts or comments, so the voting system is pointless."
46,"You might think otherwise because Twitter and Vine have no downvotes,  but they promote discovery of new content in various ways, while WordPress does not."
47,The search bar doesn't work.
48,I've tried finding my own posts with the exact same title they have and they don't appear.
49,"All of these factors make it feel deserted and lacking of a community, and discourage new users of getting into writing or reading on WordPress."
50,Also there used to be a eay to add a black outline to images; a necessity when the background is white.
51,New Upgrade = Loss of Functionality Evernote automatically updated on 9/4/14.
52,I use this app daily as part of my GTD-.
53,"I use the tags as my contexts and the notebooks to group Next Actions, Follow Up Items, etc."
54,"When I pull up a tag, I need the notes grouped by Notebook, but since the upgrade, I have lost the ability to see a snippet of the note content if I sort my notes this way."
55,"The only way to see this info is to sort by ""Date Created"" or ""Recently Update"" which is totally useless for me."
56,"Would not have ""upgraded"" if I would have known about this."
57,"Also, why can't the sort be set differently if you are on Notebook vs. Tag vs. All Notes?"
58,E.G.
59,"when I select notebooks, sort by title but when I switch to tags, sort by notebook?"
60,It's very frustrating to constantly have to switch on the fly.
61,COMPLETE GARBAGE!!!!
62,Yesterday I spent nearly an hour editing a note and adding all kinds of info to it.
63,"When I was done I saved it, and I saw the notification that said it was successfully uploaded to evernote."
64,I was able to go back and look at the note and everything was there.
65,a little bit later I tried to start a new note (using the button on the old widget -- DONT touch that after you update to the latest version!!!)
66,"but instead of opening up a blank template for a new note, IT OPENED UP THE PREVIOUS UNEDITED VERSION OF MY OTHER NOTE... from before I spent all that time adding all the additional info."
67,"There is absolutely no way of cancelling out without uploading/saving it, so this POS app saved this version of my note, completely overwriting and eliminating all the additional info I had worked so hard to create."
68,what's even WORSE!!...
69,"I spent another hour fixing that note, adding all the additional info back in, and later that night when I tried to create another new note..."
70,SAME GD PROBLEM AGAIN!!!!
71,i would be surprised if they didn't do this on purpose to try to get people to upgrade to the premium version where you can see your note history.
72,"no thanks a-holes, I'm never using evernote again!"
73,I'm sick of this app mangling and corrupting nearly everything I type!
74,This had been an issue with the Android client for years and recently started plaguing the Windows app.
75,"Words and letters often jump around randomly while trying to edit lists and checkboxes, or during copy and paste."
76,"Sometimes entire sentences disappear or move to the top or bottom line, with word order jumbled up."
77,"Years ago I used the app every day, but now I actively avoid using it as it fills me with dread."
78,I don't know how many notes I've lost due to word corruption.
79,"Tags are used instead of folders, so there's absolutely no separation between work or personal notes."
80,"Individual notes can be attached to a particular notebook, but this approach fails because the search system is broken."
81,Search occasionally displays results from EVERY note instead of only a specified notebook.
82,"I don't want to find word colleagues' information mixed in with my personal notes, but Evernote thinks it's OK. At the moment it is almost unusable for people with multiple projects all happening at the same time."
83,Tags are useless.
84,"Nobody in their right mind mixes all their client notes with their personal notes in filing cabinets, so why does Evernote assume it's acceptable?"
85,"For consulting jobs it would be nice to be able to separate each client into their own folder so there is no accidental overlap, but this is not possible with Evernote, so it remains a gimmick for me."
86,I'm slowly training myself to use OneNote because Evernote is becoming unusable due to the unresolved bugs.
87,It's so so.
88,I used Evernote with Lecturenotes.
89,"And while it was useful  to have all my notes and recordings at my fingertip in all devices (premium), there are many limitations."
90,First the app doesn't sync with Lecturenotes so I have to upload the notebook and wait for it to finish uploading to choose its location otherwise it'd upload to the same notebook.
91,"Then I have to delete the old version of the notebook if I made any change, but I it doesn't automatically update for me."
92,The notebooks aren't color-coded and I wish they appeare in tabs like in OneNote.
93,There is no options to view the pages other than scrolling vertically.
94,The recordings are at the end of the page so I have to scroll forever in big notebook.
95,"The handwriting is a huge pain, pdf notation is quite confusing and doesn't work on my tablet or phone."
96,It takes forever to load the notebook too and the so called in text search function only works 1/3 of the time.
97,"I'm having the premium right now but it doesn't seem to worth the money so maybe I'll end it next year, unless there is a major improvement."
98,2015 Update - Evernote has officially jumped the shark by removing key offline functionality for free users.
99,You used to be able to view all notebooks (but not update them) while working offline.
100,Then they restricted it so that you could only view notes that did not contain images.
101,"Now, you cannot even view basic, text-only notes - nor is there an option to save a note for viewing offline unless you upgrade."
102,"Evernote is now useless when data is not available: during oversees travel, as a frequent flyer, subway commutes, urban/underground settings (office, gym, shopping, etc)."
103,"In this day and age of FREE, full functionality organizational apps like OneNote (font changes, sketching capabilities, email to app, etc), I don't see a reason to continue using Evernote."
104,"Sadly after 3+ years of steady usage, I've barely touched Evernote in the past few months."
105,"As of today, I am transferring all of my data to OneNote where I can access my content at ALL times."
106,"Problems, Problems, Problems!"
107,"------------ First when I installed the app & got some maps, they would disappear from the phone after each re-boot."
108,"So, I wrote to the developer."
109,"No reply after a month, I wrote back."
110,No reply after two weeks.
111,------------- Next I uninstalled & re-installed the app (for the 12th time trying to fix the vanishing maps problem).
112,Now the place in Settings to tell the app where to store the maps is gone.
113,Gone!
114,(The SD is 32 GB and has 31 GB free) I wrote the developer.
115,After a week- no reply.
116,"---------- Uninstall Warning: Each time I uninstalled the app., a large folder (Over 1 GB on mine) was left behind on the phone."
117,One must use a file manager to delete it.
118,--------- I Give Up (Which is too bad because this app is easy to use.)
119,"UPDATE- As shown below, the someone from the developer company posted suggestions."
120,I had already tried (multiple times) what is suggested in the links the person posted.
121,I also had already sent e-mails to the address shown.
122,I will try one more time to contact them (because it looks like a fun & easy app).
123,"If no luck, I'll have to conclude that my phone and this app just won't play well together."
124,UPDATE- Developer replied to this review and asked me for the name I used to contact them.
125,I won't post my e-mail here.
126,(That's not a comfortable thing to do.)
127,I sent a new e-maill to them.
128,I will update the review & star rating when (if) they reply & tell me how to make this application work.
129,"I paid for the Evernote Plus to get the extra functionality on web and widget, and since the last update I regret this."
130,"Went from 5 to 3: The only thing better in the new widget, is the letter size for me."
131,"It is now impossible to use saved searches in the widget, and that was what made it so useful."
132,The  app itself works nice and does what it should.
133,But without the saved searches in the widget the whole thing is not half as handy as it used to be.
134,So for me the whole new widget collection became pretty useless.
135,"NEW EDIT:Went from 3 to 1: since the new update, I get at least 2-3 times the message that my widget list could not be loaded, and that it has to do something with my wifi."
136,All other apps work fine.
137,The previous widget worked fine.
138,"This last update really really ruined the whole Evernote experience for me, to the extent that the widget is now completely useless, frustrating me and messing up my workflow on Evernote."
139,"The interface has a few glaring violations of the ""rule of least surprise""."
140,The worst is when I'm editing an existing note and tap the back button to return to the note list.
141,"It presents a dialog asking if I'm sure I want to proceed without saving the changes, and I'm given two choices: ""OK"", which will discard the changes, and ""Cancel"", which will return to the note."
142,"There's no option to save here, and the *affirmative* choice *deletes* my edits (jeez, if you're not paying attention...)."
143,"Other apps either automatically save (which I would prefer in Evernote, and it does this for *new* notes), or ask if I want to save--not discard--the changes."
144,"Nope, in Evernote I have to reach up to the top left corner of the screen and tap the checkmark to save."
145,Another annoyance is having to tap the edit button and then tap the text to edit a note.
146,"In other apps, simply tapping the text is sufficient to bring up the keyboard."
147,"A smaller issue is the left sidebar is essentially useless, since I can't actually navigate the notebook hierarchy from it--I have to choose ""Notebooks"" to get the same fullscreen list I get by just hitting the back button."
148,I will miss you Springpad!!
149,One of the main features I expected when I signed up for Evernote was to be able to allow my husband access to edit and share my notebooks and to be able to clip webpages.
150,It seems ridiculous to have to pay per month for features that should be standard especially among members of the same household.
151,Just say you are not a free service instead of looping people in to create notebooks that they can't do anything with.
152,"AND If I wanted to save links, I could use bookmarks in my browser."
153,I can't understand why web clipping is a separate app.
154,What makes it worse is it's not available for tablets.
155,I had to find a third party app.
156,Can't delete notebooks from tablet.
157,Can't hide completed tasks.
158,Have to pay to edit offline.
159,"Evernote seems better served to desktop use, anyway."
160,Doesn't help me when I prefer not to be stuck at my desk.
161,I feel bad for all the loyal Evernote users that will probably have to upgrade to keep the features they use to have for free.
162,"Change the profile pic from the app was successful,new pic applied in WordPress web based,but in the blog owner comment reply list the blog owner gravatar still using the old previous profile pic,I wish there will be select all in Comment menu so user can select all spam comment n delete at once.Why if we change public name it doesnt change all the previous public name in older comments with new one!"
163,?the Reader tab have issue it still showing me content from blog site i have unfollow for months!
164,I swapped to Evernote from Onenote after switching to a Chromebook and being thoroughly dissappointed with Microsoft's android application.
165,"That being said, this app has much better support for Andoird however the support for Chromebook is so-so."
166,"The app relies on your device's keyboard autocorrect features, which is great....for phones."
167,My chromebook has a physical keyboard and thus doesn't have autocorrect built in.
168,It is annoying to be reading through my notes and having to also spell check everything at the same time.
169,"The drawing feature is basic, but okay."
170,"After clicking the drawing icon it opens up a new page for your drawings, and once finished will simply ""paste"" the entire large picture under your notes."
171,"It would be nice if I could just annotate my notes and draw small diagrams next to, or between, paragraphs of text notes."
172,I assume this is related to the lack of Chromebook support as that would be difficult to accomplish on a phone.
173,"You have the ability to add in photos from your gallery or dowloads into notes, which is awesome in addition to my Chromebooks ""snippet"" feature, however you can NOT resize the image from within the app."
174,"You must open the image seperately, edit the sizing of the photo (guessing on how it will fit in your notes) and then REIMPORT the image to the notes."
175,This is annoying and frustrating.
176,"All in all, this app is not bad and gets the job I need done better than Microsoft (on android) but lacks support for Chromebook."
177,Improve Chromebook support and I will happily raise my rating of this app.
178,"Its good, very useful for walking/hiking."
179,Which OSM is very good for.
180,Could  be better with search results for Car Navigation.
181,OSM doesn't really  support proper Address searching so relying solely on this isn't possible.
182,I have to go back to Google to find actual full addresses.
183,What I would  like to see changed is; - when searching the results show the downloaded  Map Name which can be confusing as it doesn't match the location of the  address.
184,(please remove this) - would be nice to have other map  overlays/textures to choose from.
185,(like osm where it shows house numbers!)
186,- Ability to sort bookmarks by Name rather than just when they were added.
187,(also when searching to show bookmarks in results) - Transport information  Trains / Bus times currently not available for the UK.
188,"I have been using evernote since years, those new premium limitations is not to my liking but I understand that income is necessary."
189,However there are several big flaws or missing features that hinder me from making it 5 stars.
190,One is the ability to overview my whole note like a text file without edit tools.
191,I mean that I just want a /read only/ feature.
192,So you can read your whole text without being able to edit it.
193,It is so easy to accidently tap on the screen and the keyboard appears.
194,Then by mistakes it edits a single character and my list of newly edited notes is wrong.
195,It would be nice also to have a shortcut to copy the entire text without having to go to edition mode.
196,This is my number one problem that makes me lose a lot of time and sometimes by doing this it accidentally edits my text so I need to fix it.
197,"I often type on my computer so I can after that send the text on my phone, since writing on computer is faster and easier."
198,Which is why.
199,Third is to be able to manage fonts in app.
200,"This feature would make evernote the best around, I have not yet seen an app do that."
201,"Perfect if it has a dark mode, I quite dislike bright white background."
202,Bravo evernote for making life so much simpler and easier :)
203,Excellent idea but poor execution.
204,There really isn't much to do game wise  especially since the majority of the content is locked behind a paywall.
205,"I  understand that they have to monetize it but at 1 million users, ad  impressions may have been a better route instead of a subscription service  that locks out the majority of your player base from the start."
206,There's  also no way to earn crystals other than paying.
207,With so little to do and so  much unavailable unless you pay (with no options to try before you buy)  gives me little motivation to come back.
208,Some advice: ●Make the quests you  can buy with gold cheaper.
209,200 coins takes forever to grind and there's not  much to do otherwise.
210,"● Have a way for f2p players to earn crystals (maybe  through daily login bonuses, level up bonuses or grind and buy them with  gold)."
211,●Offline capabilities especially for checklists and tasks.
212,I  shouldn't need the internet to check off my to do list.
213,●Have the ability  to choose your class at the start and allow players to change class  whenever they'd like.
214,Having to wait until you're level 10 is too much of a  grind.
215,●Have a little more customization available from the start (maybe a  freeby starter egg or a background or outfit).
216,Literally everything is  locked behind crystal pay walls...even the character backgrounds are a  whopping 15 crystals .
217,That just screams greedy.
218,Everything works smoothly.
219,Evernote is a solid cloud based note app with fuctions for formatting text.
220,I have an issue of great importance to me with the app.
221,The quick note option in the notification bar is not appearing for me.
222,"I check the box in the settings to allow it, but nothing changes."
223,It's fustrating.
224,That was the main way i would create new text notes before i switched to my current device.
225,I've been using Evernote much less due to it.
226,LG Stylo 5 from Spectrum
227,"I love the potential of Evernote and its cross functionality with other apps / services thanks to IFTTT,  but what used to be quite a streamlined,  smooth and fast app is feeling bloated and clunky."
228,"Using it for anything but the simplest is not fluid nor simple,  it's beginning to feel like a chore."
229,It's usability is also clunky.
230,I'll give one example and it's my biggest issue to date.
231,It's what prompted me to write this and re-rate the app.
232,I use a lot of checklists and I am constantly adding and removing lines as well as checking things off.
233,Evernote always handles moving through the note in the most frustrating waiting way possible.
234,"If I add a line,  the text cursor is there."
235,"If I scroll elsewhere in the list and tick or uptick an option it does so,  but then focus returns back to where the cursor was and I have to scroll all the way back."
236,It does this same focus shift when I want to edit a different line of text.
237,"I tap there,  I see the cursor flash so I start typing,  but the cursor didn't actually move and again focus is whipped back to my previous edit!"
238,It's very frustrating.
239,The only use for this app over google is it shows trails and jungle footpaths.
240,After that its 'EFFING USELESS.
241,The pointer spins constantly so you cant tell which way you're facing.
242,"It points 180 degrees out and the blue dotted line follows you, ie it can send you back the way you came and not leave your start point blank....so you still think youre going the right way as youre always attached to the dotted line."
243,"It should let the pointer move away from the dotted line, then you can see youre off course."
244,If you brush the screen it opens a new dropped pin which then deletes the path you were following.
245,I cant bookmark anything.
246,"Theres paths highlighted in red that i didnt add, it constantly directs you to road routes even tho i only want mountain footpaths and have it set to walking."
247,"It does work offline for me which is 1 reason not to boot it just yet but its useless to navigate with, i use it just to look for trails."
248,Thankfully im not getting ads cos thailand auto blocks anything that isnt of profit directly to them.
249,"You need to disable the info sharing, apparently this app sells info on you 20 times more than other apps"
250,"the new ""upgrade"" is a joke."
251,If you are looking for note taking app DO NOT USE THIS UNTIL THEY GET IT FIXED.
252,I used to love this and it worked really well for me.
253,I gladly paid for the premium upgrade.
254,I was able to save and print notes as PDF's.
255,their spell check was never great but at least you could add a word and if you were lucky it would remember it.
256,"Now even basic words are shown as misspelled and there is no option to add a word to the dictionary I can no longer print individual pages, it is either all or nothing and that leads to a huge waste of paper."
257,I have several notes as check-lists and tried to edit one today on my PC and it did not format properly to match my existing note.
258,I had to make the change on my phone and then it showed up correctly on my PC I am looking for a new app to replace the mess that Evernote has become
259,"Extremely laggy with long notes, almost unusable."
260,"Many people have this problem apparently, as I've been searching online for a way to fix this to no avail."
261,"Also, if you have multiple pictures in one note, good luck opening a particular picture when you're browsing through your note."
262,"No matter which picture you click on, it opens the first picture you ever attached to your note and gives you the option to just scroll through all the pictures you've uploaded to that note."
263,"As a paying, premium user, it is surprisingly impossible to reach support through the app or browser."
264,"I tried to send them an email, and got an automated reply saying you have to post your questions or complaints on the Evernote forums."
265,Really?
266,"I'm paying a yearly subscription, and I can't reach customer support?"
267,Really??
268,You'd assume such a massively popular and old app that gets frequent updates would have had bugs like these fixed years ago...
269,I'm currently starting a Google search for other reliable note taking apps.
270,Edit: Last update has drastically fixed the lag issue with long notes.
271,"I'm not sure if they fixed it on purpose or by mistake, but I'm not going to take any chances updating the app again after this in case the next update brings back the lag again."
272,I used to love this app and I use it a lot for work and personal info organisation.
273,The latest update is an utter disaster for me.
274,"It requires a constant internet connection, which I - and millions of other people on this planet - don't have."
275,"I used to be able to work on notes whether I was online or offline - a helpful little red exclamation symbol would appear on the sync item when the app couldn't sync because the internet was down, so I would be careful not to change to working on the same note on a different device."
276,Now the app insists on me reloading the note when the internet is down and wipes out my latest edits.
277,This is useless!
278,I don't want to have to remove the sync setting as I do want the app to sync regularly when I'm online.
279,"If this continues to be a problem I will, finally, have to relinquish my subscription and migrate to a different tool."
280,(NB the Windows 10 app update doesn't even appear to have the option to change the sync setting at all - in fact the settings menu seems to have disappeared completely!!!)
281,DO NOT create notes with this app that you plan on storing for a long time.
282,I've been a daily user of this app for about a year.
283,I've seen notes that were full of information just clear themselves for no reason and save as the most current.
284,I try to pull up the old note full of information on another device in an attempt to bring the note back from the dead and failed.
285,If you edit a note on different devices (My experience was PC and Android) you will have note conflicts all the time.
286,"When a conflict occurs, it's impossible to save the note with the correct information."
287,"I've lost shopping lists, recipes, to do lists,  just about everything."
288,Evernote is absolute garbage.
289,"Anything else, including pen and paper is an upgrade from this app."
290,You are flaming idiots.
291,I tried being nice and simply asked you to remove my name devices and any notes or images you have for or from me in your system .
292,"your stupid answer to me from write us( here on this page), was;   we don't respond to these emails at this address( referring to this page at Google play store) you do not respond to any thing as far as I can tell."
293,"do not ever email me again with your moronic ""we are limiting users to 2 devices"" campaign."
294,"apparently you do not want users   Your motto "" stay organized"" what a joke as if you could even link with any PIM or even Lotus organizer."
295,you are a legend in your own mind.
296,Here's something for you.
297,"I barely used your slow stupid app any way, good bye and good riddance to all greedy apps."
298,you're just another greedy drop box clone.
299,I demand all traces of your app and any info about me or my devices be removed from your site and all your files at your corporation.
300,if you do not comply I will take action.
301,good bye and good riddance    NO star for you next?
302,Ugh.
303,Every 'update' frustrates me to no end.
304,I have things working as they should... then an update like the latest wrecks everything.
305,Content in limbo.
306,Endless upload errors.
307,Takes forever to post.
308,And... ugh... what happened to my custom image resize controll'?
309,Once upon a time this app worked beautifully and did what it should... you see... people posting from their phones are ON THE GO!
310,I just want to post quickly with no hassle- the control needed but not clutter.
311,"Many times its mobile data, in a remote location."
312,The app used to be lean and mean and do the job perfectly.
313,Now its like it's a mini desktop app that's bogged down with junk.
314,What used to take seconds... select some pics on phone ... share to WP app... add text hit upload and DONE... is now futz with this and that ... fight the awful quirks ...hit post and wait wait wait...error.
315,error.
316,Wrangle things back to where they work again....then get blitzed by the next update
317,"Don't Mess With A Good Thing I love Evernote, but some recent changes are not so good."
318,"Web clippings now have the hyperlink hidden in the information icon, which means more clicking to get back to the original article."
319,Which brings me to the new changes with the web interface.
320,"The URL is also hidden in the ""information"" icon, and its not a hyperlink that can be clicked."
321,You have to copy and paste into the address bar of a new browser tab.
322,":-(    Also the layout of the web interface now has no view of snippets of notes, unless you click on the notebook icon."
323,More clicking is bad :-(  The old interface was great.
324,"You could at all times see your notebooks, snippets, and plenty of space for viewing the current note."
325,Bring it back.
326,Good idea in theory but the interface is way too ham-handed.
327,"If I try to set multiple reminders for a task, it seems like it would allow it, but then it discards the second reminder time and only saves the first one."
328,Moving tasks up and down the list doesn't work properly (lags and jitters).
329,Tapping refresh puts them back in their original order making re-sequencing them pointless.
330,Which brings me to another point: refresh has to be tapped constantly to see changes that you make.
331,I created a habit and it seemingly disappeared right after hitting save and wouldn't appear until I refreshed.
332,"Also, how do I hear the theme song?"
333,I can change it in the settings but tapping each option simply changes which one is active.
334,How am I supposed to know which theme I want if I can't preview it?
335,Another problem is the tutorial: tapping the menu items at the bottom didn't always activate each sections tutorial.
336,"For example, I tapped on To-do and created some items, then went to Rewards, saw that tutorial, went back to To-do, and then the app decided to display the tutorial for To-do."
337,"Making tasks, habits and goals like an RPG is a great idea."
338,"But honestly, I think most people would get frustrated at this clunky interface and just give up after 5 or 10 minutes like I did."
339,inconvinient interface The new update is as stylish and beautiful as it inconvenient and wrong.
340,"I didn't used all the new ""features"" so I'll comment only few of them."
341,1.
342,"Note editing - After the last update, I need to roll up the note to make this little green circle appear."
343,"But if I roll the note to it's end the circle disappear, so I need to roll in up a little bit once again."
344,Why?!
345,Why reinvent the wheel?
346,You have a H-U-G-E bar at the top of the screen.
347,"Just push all control and navigation there, without useless animations."
348,Please.
349,2.
350,"Typing while note editing - When you editing a note, some other circle appear at the right-bottom corner of the screen, above the keyboard, exactly at the same place where the text ends."
351,"so instead of placing the cursor an the end of my text, I'm pressing this circle (with ""A"")."
352,"I use it on Note 3, so it's not like I has a tiny screen."
353,Once again: the H_U_G_E bar at the top of the screen can successfully contain this control.
354,"Please, review the interface design, because Evernote is one of the most useful apps."
355,"Switching to OneNote, cause the very basic is missing : NO ACCESS TO THE WEB = NO NOTES TAKEN OR MODIFIED + 2 Devices only with new rules + BloatWare on Samsung, very sad !!"
356,"Was best Cross Platforms Notes App, but I HATE that the Offline mode is to buy and *SO EXPENSIVE*: at least 60$/year, every year!"
357,IT SHOULD BE THE VERY BASIC FREE OPTION.
358,Other options and business options could be charged?
359,EVEN MORE SAD: new free version rule is ONLY 2 DEVICES -&gt; BUT YOU CAN'T DISABLE or UNINSTALL on SAMSUNG PHONES!
360,SO I REAAALLY START TO HATE THIS APP: NOT BEING ABLE TO USE or REMOVE BUT BEING FORCED TO KEEP... AND UPGRADE... AND USE MY STORAGE!
361,SO BAD!
362,INSANE and switching to OneNote
363,Still doesn't have it all...
364,"It's quite great because you can access your info from your PC, tablet, phone.. and it has a simple, clean interface."
365,"BUT, it lacks the very ""androidy"" things like color options for your lists or notes, color options for what you write in those notes, color options for the highlighter (damn it!!!!"
366,"), an overall dark theme (what?"
367,some people prefer a dark background..).
368,"Plus, the text editor could really use a remake... it doesn't behave like a normal text editor (like when using backspace, or enter, or other stuff...)."
369,"AND, probably the most annoying mishap: if you want to make a note with several check-lists inside, you cannot auto-number the title of those check-lists.... seriously... get your $hit together.... don't be a OneNote imitator..."
370,"Abusive permissions (calendar, camera, contacts, location, microphone,  phone, storage)."
371,"No free e-mail support, offline access to notes on mobile,  unlimited monthly uploads, free-form canvas, save email into your notes, or  business card scanning (all of which OneNote offers for free)."
372,Spams you  with unsolicited e-mails and notification ads.
373,Limited to 2 devices unless  you pay.
374,Starts automatically in the background after phone startup.
375,Privacy policy lets Evernote employees read your notes.
376,"Keeps your screen  on when in the foreground, wasting your battery."
377,"I upgraded to Premium so I could easily switch between my personal and work accounts on my tablet, but can't find a way to do that."
378,"Signing out says it'll remove all my notes and even offline notebooks from the device, so I can't switch accounts manually without losing everything from the device."
379,"I can't find anything in the Help And Learning section for Android, and the Mac and Windows methods don't work on the tablet."
380,"On top of that, the Support system is broken: I can select the What Can We Help You With dropdown, but the Select A Topic has no options under any choice, and I can't find a way to get past that point."
381,"So really it's just a big frustration, and the reason I paid for Premium turns out to be unavailable to me on the device where I most want it."
382,"If I had purchased Premium on my work account, maybe I could share notebooks and sort of hack the same result, but I bought it for my personal account and still can't access my work account here."
383,Ugh.
384,Annoying and disappointing.
385,Too bad the Premium hype makes no mention of device issues.
386,I wanted to like this app.
387,I'm looking for an alternative to google maps.
388,"The routing is actually ok, although the estimated timings don't take traffic conditions into account."
389,"The offline operation is good, but there isn't really an 'online' mode."
390,If I currently have a good connection I want to be able to search a new area without having to download the section first.
391,But what has killed it for me is that the search is useless.
392,"There us no UK postcode search, which is what I primarily use."
393,"Searching by street name sometimes works, but often comes up empty."
394,"Conversely when there are multiple matches adding extra location details (borough, etc) doesn't narrow the search effectively."
395,"As far as i can tell it treats each term entered separately and at some point if you haven't chosen one of the matches for your first term and keep typing it switches to searching on the second term, ignoring the first."
396,"I only managed to experience the navigation by finding places on Google maps, and then matching the street pattern and zooming to find them manually in this."
397,"I gather it works better in some countries than others, so I'll probably try it again sometime, but for now I'm giving up."
398,Bloated and very slow.
399,On my (admittedly not so fast) Lenovo P780 (android 4.2.1)  the app takes about 7 seconds to start (comparing to keep which starts almost instantly).
400,When I edit a note it takes 2-3 seconds to get to edit screen.
401,"Creating a note is also laggish, I need to first click on + button and it takes like 0.5 seconds to pop up the menu which consists of many items out of which I have ever used one - ""text note""."
402,Not taking about countless upgrade proposals which are so annoying.
403,"Isn't related to the mobile app, but the website it terrible: slow, cumbersome UI + upgrade screen every time I get in."
404,I've been using evernote for several years (after catchnotes went down) but switched to keep the day I have discovered it.
405,Was able to connect to my personally hosted blog.
406,"Everything looks pretty good, but the Featured Image setting doesn't work."
407,"I add an image from my Media Library, then edit its properties...Check the box for ""Featured Image"" and then leave the box for ""Show in post"" unchecked, but it always just shows the image in the post and refuses to set it as the Featured image, no matter how many times I go back and try to edit it/redo it."
408,"Unfortunately, that was the main function I was hoping to use, so pretty worthless to me."
409,"2½ years ago I wanted to be able to take notes on my phone and have them backed up to the cloud, and it did that task perfectly."
410,Then I discovered I could access them on the web from my PC and that was wonderful.
411,"Then I bought a tablet and it immediately picked up all my notes and life was perfect, as it happily synched all three devices (phone, tablet and PC)."
412,Then I changed my phone and it all went horribly wrong.
413,"It hadn't occurred to me to log out of the account on my old phone before doing a factory reset, so when I tried to synch the new one, Evernote saw it as a fourth device."
414,I either had to upgrade to the premium package at £45/y or disable not one but TWO devices.
415,I was able to disable the old phone's account but that was not enough.
416,"I now have to live without it being on one of my devices, which is a right pain."
417,Evernote is unquestionably good but it's not worth £45/y so I'm not upgrading.
418,The only alternative is to look for another app.
419,"As soon as I've found a suitable one, I'll be removing Evernote from all my devices."
420,"Great App, wish tablet UI had better usability Love the Evernote application for its function (sharing across multiple platforms/users), but I wish the direction taken on the tablet UI was more like the PC, web and mobile app."
421,"Having only the snippet view is very inconvenient, especially when dealing with folders with many files, and maintaining things like tags, etc."
422,PLEASE GIVE US A LIST VIEW OPTION!!!
423,Definitely worth 5 stars then!
424,"UPDATE: After latest update, have to say the mobile (phone) UI is WAY more desireable than the tablet UI."
425,"Please consider syncing these up, or at least give us the option of which to install/use!"
426,What happened to the full editor??!!!
427,"Went to create a blog post today using my WordPress app and discovered that the editor is some weird, useless version of what it was before."
428,"I can't do anything in it like I can in the web based editor such as indent, center, size/place images, etc....literally every major function but basic typing is gone."
429,Where did it go and how do I get it back?
430,If this is not fixed I am uninstalling the app as it is totally useless to me without the full version of the editor.
431,"As well, the web based editor crashes EVERY SINGLE TIME I do an update to a blog."
432,Makes editing virtually impossible.
433,"- - - I received an automated response to this review which said, ""You can switch back to the app's old editor: Go to App Settings in the app and toggle off the 'Show Visual Editor' option."
434,"However, some of the features you mentioned (such as indenting or aligning text) weren't part of the old editor, either."""
435,- - - Found the setting.
436,That leaves ONLY the HTML editor and does not fix the problem...at all.
437,"And, previously, before this change, the editor in my app and the web based editor were identical in their features."
438,Inferior in every possible way to using the online editor.
439,"This app doesn't allow you to link to your own earlier posts, crashes often, can sometimes delet your whole draft even unsave a previously update and saved page, and has issues previewing images."
440,It also cannot pull the most recent version of you updates which you created with the web editor.
441,"Woe be unto you if you mak long pots, because after a certain size copy/paste stop working and the editor gets so slow you have to wait for the displayed text to catch up to you."
442,"What it does do well is present your stats page, manage the site permissions and let you get a rough draft started."
443,Though it has so many problems I'm just using the MS Office apps for my rough drafts and then copy/pasting into the web interface.
444,I'll probably uninstall this soon because it is basically horrible.
445,I've used this app for years (since Verizon updated my operating system and deleted the inbedded note app - lost EVERYTHING) and it's always been buggy/difficult to use.
446,"I've lost notes, partially & fully, due to Evernote's saving methods."
447,I've been unable to access or edit notes because I was in an area with no phone service.
448,This has cost me time & money.
449,They also send spam emails that you can't unsubscribe from.
450,"I got a new phone, but use old ones as tablets & backups, and they want me to pay a recurring fee to keep the app on all three."
451,NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.
452,You just aren't that useful  I'll just go back to using gmail to manage my notes.
453,I can access that pretty much ANYWHERE with pretty much ANY connection (or no connection) for free.
454,Right.
455,I am having serious issues trying to just type notes in my Evernote.
456,I tried accessing support and couldn't.
457,I tried sending an activity log but when I click on the option to submit a ticket (as you have advised others here to do).
458,I get brought round in circles and can't submit one.
459,The app is unusable now.
460,"I have been using Evernote for 6 years, this issue is only since the last update."
461,"If I tried to type:  17:30 84 sg236 stop 4202  I get: 1:73330 84a ss23 ststop 420222 As you can see, when trying to keep a log it is utterly impossible and trying to go back and correct the errors just creates even more."
462,It types whatever it wants.
463,And Evernote is the ONLY app this happens in.
464,Please Advise.
465,Because I can't access support.
466,"I am writing this review because when I wanted to contact the support team , there is no option unless i ""UPGRADE"" meaning i have to pay money just to ""TALK TO THEM""  I am writing here to tell you that I have been using your Evernote App for many many years now."
467,I am saddened to say and quite angry at you guys right now due to the fact that my notes that have been piling for years are gone.
468,"You see, my phone and laptop are on sync."
469,I broke my laptop hence bought a new one.
470,"So i installed your App, login -- and NO NOTES WERE THERE."
471,Did I sync?
472,ofcourse i did.
473,I know how technology works.
474,"So ofc i sync, again and again and again."
475,Nothing.
476,"All i get is ""My first Notebook"".."
477,I am highly dissapointed.
478,Pretty damn sure none of you are gonna retrieve back all my notebooks coz i didnt pay anything.
479,I am even scared to sync my phone anymore.
480,"Coz if i sync, pretty dman sure it's gonna follow what is on the website."
481,- A BLANK Notebook..  thanks Evernote.
482,"I'm not gonna keep you anymore, highly dissapointed."
483,"Idea is great and I love using this app, but parts need refining."
484,"Sorting items (ToDos, Dailies, etc) from the app doesn't persist, but doing so from the website does."
485,"There is a widget for Habits and Dailies, but not for ToDos, and I this ToDos is the list people would best like to see made into a widget."
486,There is no clean way to take back a button press (If you accidentaly pressed on + and didn't mean to your options are leave it as is even though you didn't earn the rewards or edit the task to include a minus option and take the HP hit).
487,Would be nice if you could automatically sort by Due Date ascending.
488,"Creating a Daily and setting it to all days, then editing it and removing the current day still leaves the Daily Active (Same with the reverse if it was first created as not enabled for this day of the week, then editing and enabling it, it remains disabled)."
489,"Etc , My point is the idea is amazing, there is a huge community behind it which is great, and I personally love the app."
490,But it lacks polish around the edges and some bugs could be fixed.
491,It used to be great but now it won't let me save unless I have WiFi?
492,"I have a farm and have used Evernote for years for homeschooling, kids medical records, recipes etc."
493,"But I need to be able to quickly note the new lambs' weights and snap a quick picture, and now the app won't save edits I make outside, I think bcz WiFi is spotty in the field."
494,I don't see that I need WiFi to make the note.
495,Can't I just work offline and sync in the house?
496,- (edited to add - i wish the new note size restrictions hadn't come right in the middle of lambing season.
497,"I tried out a few competitors, decided i still love the way EVernote looks and works, and made a new note (Lambing Records 2017 Part II) - but it only took info for two ewe's lambs and then it was too small."
498,I am so disappointed (and frustrated) - i hope the importer tool works smoothly so i can be prepared for the next ewe that lambs!).
499,"I do really love Evernote, but all i use it for is taking important notes (children's doctors notes, farm records, etc) - and i need something reliable."
500,Right now i feel like Evernote will change the rules on me yet again in an attempt to make me pay 120$ a year for an electronic notebook :(
501,"Bugs, Bugs, Bugs in the Latest Update This app worked great and loved the material design update a couple weeks ago."
502,But the latest update has bugs that affected both my Android version and Mac version.
503,Notes appear with no content although it's there...like white text on white background.
504,I had to complete uninstall and reinstall on Mac to fix the issue.
505,"But in a meeting today, I found the same on my Android tablet."
506,It also locked up when trying to send a note to another person's email.
507,My tablet is a brand new Nvidia Shield running Lollipop so this shouldn't be an issue with legacy hardware.
508,Hope they roll out a fix soon because I use Evernote a lot for work.
509,Getting rid of this crap.
510,All these years I was using evernote with pride and now you guys have made it completely cloud based.
511,Why would you make  offline access  a premium feature all of a sudden??
512,Your premium charges are quite excessive considering the type of service.
513,Plus I'm not going to pay a single cent because you guys have created a MESS out of premium features.
514,Some key features are buggy on this app such as adding new notebooks.
515,Please note that your new Web ui and this app delays my work as it takes forever to load.
516,"Poor implementation of a good idea I thought that the idea of being able to create notes and sync them between desktop and mobile phone was a great idea, as I find that working on my desktop PC for most things is much easier than doing the same on my phone."
517,"However, I have discovered that the Browser implementation of Evernote is very buggy and frustrating to use."
518,"I like the idea of being able to insert images into my notes, which Evernote allows, but the Browser version does not allow insertion of new images between existing ones."
519,Every image you try to insert will only go to the end of the note.
520,You literally have to delete the entire existing note and recreate it if you want to insert a new image.
521,Another bug exists when trying to change the font characteristics of any text you have already typed into the note.
522,"The system will often not allow the change, and will keep reverting back to the old font style and size."
523,"I have emailed their tech support about these problems, but have never received a reply or any help whatsoever."
524,"Hopefully, it's because they are spending all of their time trying to solve these bugs."
525,"In the meantime, I have decided to move on to another app, which so far is working much better."
526,BRING BACK IN-NOTE SEARCH I've been using this app for years.
527,Love it.
528,"But suddenly, after switching to Android, I've noticed that when I use the search key, it searches all my notes."
529,"It used to be that if I tapped that icon, it would search within that note, finding the key text right then and there, highlighting it."
530,"Now when I type something in the search box, it comes up with the Note it found it in, then I have to scroll within my note again to find the highlighted text."
531,"Please Evernote, please bring the in note search back!"
532,Not able to find business tags on android nor on web version Since I switched to business evernote im not able to find notes by searching tags using android or the web version.
533,"I have more than 3000 notes, more than 5000 tags and support is not helpful to find a solution."
534,People i share business notebooks with have same problem.
535,On top of that web version is very slow even with closed tags.
536,There is no way to stop displaying pdf attachments on web version neither.
537,I have almost a month with theses problems and no solutions.
538,Unable to open any of my previously saved notes.
539,Have made sure all files are synced.
540,Have updated app.
541,Have tried reinstalling the app.
542,All notes appear in the list but still won't open when clicked on.
543,Always getting the messages: 1.
544,Continue waiting?
545,Sorry this note is still loading.
546,2.
547,Note edit error.
548,Oops.
549,We are unable to open your note.
550,Please try again later.
551,This is for notes originally started on the app as well as on the website and notes with only a few lines of text in them.
552,Too many ads.
553,Even more than Google Maps.
554,At least most of the features work in a general sense; just not in my area.
555,"EDIT: I understand that advertising is a resource that allows for development to continue, but you must understand the current default implementation makes any features very unappealing and the entire experience unenjoyable."
556,I uninstalled imediately after the second push ad.
557,Push ads are unacceptable in any form.
558,"I am aware you can opt out of most advertising by going to settings and switching off ""Show offers"", but there's no garuntee your app will stop giving other unwanted push notifications, such as the one asking if the user is aware of the bookmarking feature."
559,"DO NOT engage the user outside of the app unless it is for a currently requested function or feature they are actively using, such as continuing navigation while in the background."
560,There are better ways to let users know of features.
561,"For example, highlight the area you want to be noticed and give a brief message when the app is launched."
562,"This is more benificial for you as well, because a user is more likely to follow through when they have already chosen to engage with the app, as opposed to you trying to pull them away from whatever else they may be doing."
563,"NEW REVIEW Okay, here's the thing."
564,I just got an email saying I can only use it one two devices (free one).
565,"That's bull, and here's why...I have a tablet, phone and laptop."
566,I access Evernote on each.
567,"I don't use enough data to pay for it, and guess what?"
568,I don't have to.
569,"Microsoft has a free WORD app now, and it at least lets me adjust to darker themes and change the font size on Android."
570,I can save online and access with all of my devices.
571,"I was staying with Evernote out of loyalty, but this is the last straw."
572,I exported all my notes and I am DONE.
573,OLD REVIEW STILL no dark theme option for people who are light sensitive.
574,Been years waiting for this.
575,Tired of waiting.
576,"Also, this inability to change font size in app makes it even worse on the eyes, especially since default size is only 10 pt."
577,Font!
578,Visually impaired old people like me need bigger font sizes.
579,"Decent not great, too many invasive permissions The typing and note-taking parts of the app are ok. Bugs in erasing type happen frequently."
580,"The notes you type in the web version are not fully compatible with the app version, which is really frustrating."
581,"The biggest complaint I have is how many privacy permissions they gave themselves - the latest update gives them a new permission, to add, create, delete, and set passwords for user accounts on the device."
582,Why the h*** do they need that permission?
583,"They also have permission to read and copy your contacts, to read your phone call status, to track how often you text or call each of your contacts!"
584,I am uninstalling this app.
585,Too much for too little.
586,I have several sites that run WordPress and finally getting around to reviewing this WordPress app.
587,"To sum it up, it really isn't all that great."
588,The dashboard within WordPress by default allows galleries and custom posts.
589,All this app does is allows you to write a blog and add a photo or video.
590,"There is no setting featured image, adding a gallery and unless you modify the dimensions of the photo you insert, it will maintain the full size."
591,Just log into WordPress via the Web and do your stuff there.
592,Won't sync all the time and won't let me edit I have several notes that won't actually sync properly.
593,"The view mode shows the updated info, but when I edit it, it's outdated."
594,Syncing does nothing on my phone.
595,"Also when I edit it it tells me ""this note contains some unsupported formatting"" and says ""This version of evernote does not support inline editing of webclips..."" Funny thing is that it's not a webclip."
596,"It's text, typed into a note."
597,Very simple and should let me edit it...
598,Even when I copied the info into a new note it gave me the same error.
599,"HTC Aria  UPDATE: Okay, still not sure why it wasn't updating some notes, but the ""webclip"" problem seemed to be caused by inserting ""horizontal rules"" into the note."
600,As soon as I removed those it let me edit the note on my phone again.
601,Silly.
602,No support I did not ask for a new password but one was imposed on me.
603,"So I have been unable to access my  notes for several days and because I have not upgraded to premium, ie paid, I cannot get online help."
604,Instead I keep receiving instructions to reset the password which I have done endlessly to no avail.
605,To me this is blackmail.
606,"No pay, no help."
607,I really thought this was a terrific app and had recommended it to a number of friends.
608,"In fact, I enjoyed showing how sophisticated and downright useful it was--until this happened."
609,"Now I have lost information that will take weeks to reconstruct and I am way beyond angry that this was done to me, without my permission or acceptance, and I cannot get any help to reconstruct beyond repetitive e-mails that don't help."
610,"If anyone would care to call me from Evernote, I would be thrilled to change this review back to 5 stars."
611,"Very frustrating that you cant get checked items to disappear, shopping lists become useless except by painstaking erasing of words."
612,But the biggest problem is that you cant save to external card.
613,My phone is getting choked up.
614,Evernote instructions tells you to delete stuff but that is not good enough.
615,Also you cant print from Android.
616,Update June 2016.
617,Downgraded from 4* to 1*.
618,Two devices not enough and subscription too costly for a casual user.
619,But had to remove anyway from main phone as not enough space.
620,So now moved everything to One Note.
621,"Kept this app on one phone in meantime in case later updates solve the storage problems, but unlikely as it is policy."
622,This despite android addressing sd security!
623,"Expecially after the updates of the last months, the app shows issues that make it not usable:  -it cannot make a path on a map not updated (and if you are abroad without Internet and unlucky enough to miss the update, you cannot use the app, which denies the usefulness of it); -you cannot zoom on the rough map if you do not download the detailed map first, so you cannot get an idea of zones you did not download (not even the zones that are clearly visible on the rough map when not zooming); -full of pop-ups and messages you cannot remove, covering the map and being extremely annoyng; -the ""search"" option is horrible, sometimes cannot find even extremely famous places (try searching ""San Marco"" in Venice...)."
624,I used to give this app 5 stars but recent years' updates have rendered it almost useless for me.
625,I use it to list my stamp sets (paper crafting) and punches but now I can't edit photos before saving them in a note and today search is not working.
626,This is highly frustrating.
627,I am looking for a new way of organizing my crafting items on my android tablet.
628,"Evernote, you had a great app but you've ruined it with updates."
629,:-(
630,"Solution to an important problem, but.."
631,I have a love-hate relationship with Evernote.
632,"It the best information collector for me, but it lacks those little things that make me say WOW."
633,"For example, this Android version does not support the same (basic) formating of the desktop version, meaning I can not work solely on my tablet if I want to structure my note text in a way that makes it more meaningful and easier to read."
634,"Or, to have your notes available off line, you have to select each note book, one at a time, make a few clicks to set it to keep it off line, and then you have to wait while that syncs because if you try the next, the dialog keeps popping away before you can use it, until the pervious one is synced."
635,"This would be a bit OK, if you only had to do it once, but three times the ongoing sync stopped until I deleted everything, and then had to start all over."
636,"And event this would be OK, if Evernote would listen and act on these annoyances, but instead they go on a develop new features for their new business ideas, and leave the chance for a great product lagging."
637,"Oh, yeah, they tend to develope things (related apps, etc.)"
638,"first for iOS, and only later, if at all for Android."
639,"Still, I recommend it to all!"
640,"Reduction of performance Useful app plus web tutorials are great however, it is slow, to do lists are clumsy and do not allow for removing completed tasks easily."
641,The interface is missing the ability to edit notes created by a rich text editor.
642,"Finally, business card scanning is missing and there is a persistent error when trying to use the page scanner."
643,Useful but to be improved.
644,1) it's missing a search field.
645,"2) no multi select and upload of multiple images from a single folder, it's either messy all together or one by one."
646,"3) I lost the whole text and images of a new post because of an internet connection error, this should not happen no matter how bad the connection is, offline editing is what users expect from an application vs the web-admin!"
647,4) post settings button is hidden when keyboard is open 5) can't edit site url 6) can't batch upload local charges
648,I liked this app at first because of the emmense amount of features to make very customizable notes and list from check boxes and formatting.
649,"Its just unusable now where I am in a job where I need to be able to find information, access it, and make changes very quickly."
650,"The load time for a list is ""unbearably"" long (two seconds may seem like nothing but cumulatively from opening app everytime you switch screens whether loading a 1 line list, saving, or just pressing back)."
651,Wonderful potential and with excellent content but not very well executed.
652,UI poor & buggy; connectivity & state-saving bugs; unintuitive & hazy.
653,"However, still a tremendous tool with (I don't use this term lightly) life-changing potential despite!"
654,I feel as though the gamification aspect is tangential but foundational to the system design.
655,"If the user relies on the superficial static pixel-art RPG as the primary mechanic incentivizing their real-world habits, tasks & challenges, they'll plateau real fast, as there isn't much substance to the 'game' side."
656,"The social/game features (custom avatars &c.) are steeply ramped to try to drive pay-for-play schemes, so the appeal to some of a casual showoff/hangout sort of play are curtailed."
657,"Some of the user-contributed content (mostly in Challenges but also in general chatpost/Tavern) is excellent; imagine self-help style microlessons but from evidence-based and therapeutically-sound sources, as well as plenty of great personal strategic content and tips from a range of people suffering from a variety of impediments to routine/studying/self-care/productivity/etc."
658,sharing what's worked for them.
659,"Incredible, and there's also arts exposure, bookclubbing, hobbyisting, and more being done through the system as well."
660,Bottom line is same as the top: This has awesome potential to (actually) help people improve their lives but the system isn't designed very well and on top of that the app isn't up to professional standards.
661,Don't have it?
662,"Get it, and start it."
663,Try it for a couple weeks if you can.
664,Keep reading...
665,Routes are unstable.
666,While following proposed route I was requested to turn back and follow a new route.
667,"Missing ""do not download"" option in map diwnload dialog window."
668,Unable to configure localisation of the map directory.
669,Menu bar disappears at random?
670,Navigation proposes routes violating the law and mistakes public roads with field roads.
671,After update navigation is much worse.
672,No perspective view despite it is enabled in settings.
673,"Calculating a route is slow, arrival estimation changed from optimistic (below 4h) to pessimistic (over 8h) for a route Krapkowice-Warszawa (Poland, realistic estimate ca 5h)."
674,Rerouting freezes very often.
675,Figured out how to enable perspective view.
676,"I had to disable it, close the app, reopen the app and enable it."
677,I fear of other bugs.
678,I almost rated this for stars.
679,"It's a nice, useful app with some gaps--I really like the basic idea and the maps themselves are accurate and occasionally have nice details (for example, airport gate numbers)."
680,"There are some major gaps in searching for foods, shopping, etc., though."
681,Primarily this is just in not having locations.
682,"For example, in one city in Japan I did a search for food and it came up with maybe 3 or 4 places when I was aware of dozens close by."
683,"Since it pretty quickly looks for options further away, I was getting results up to fifty miles away (in Japan, traveling fifty miles can take several hours)."
684,It also missed the biggest shopping center in the area.
685,"Still, it's handy for knowing where you are and had the ability to download sections of the world's you're interested in.the interface is also easy to navigate and it came up with Japanese city names easily even though I was using English letters."
686,"Train stations are well-marked and it's pretty easy to follow along with your reason trip to know how much further you need to go and where to get off (note that the routing itself i s by driving rather than public transport, which would have been a nice feature, but that you can simply see where the tracks are)."
687,"Updated review: I have used this app for half a year, against my better judgement."
688,I have sent eighteen bug reports to the devs.
689,Little.
690,"I could easily send another twenty more, but it isn't worth the time."
691,This is simply the most bugged piece of software I have ever used.
692,The avatars are hideous.
693,"The only good thing that this app has going for it is the clean user interface, and a clever separation of the to-do list into three sections."
694,It is missing some pretty basic to-do list functionality.
695,"The game loads slowly, and doesn't work without an internet connection."
696,"Some of the bugs I've experienced: Reminders pop up on random days, no matter how many times I readjust their settings."
697,Constantly having trouble connecting to the servers.
698,"Visual bugs: shows one item, but you get some other item."
699,Newly equipped main weapon won't show on avatar until app restarted.
700,Progress bars for quests spaz out every time you open the page.
701,Keyboards won't go away once they pop up.
702,And the list goes on and on...
703,Doesn't post a new blog if I clear the 'uploading...' notification The new blog posting process is somehow interrupted and doesn't finish completely if I clear the 'uploading...' notification.
704,As a user I would assume that such a process should continue in the background.
705,"Next, if I open the app again, it doesn't show any indication of the ongoing process which doesn't give me any kind of update (of whether the new blog got completely/half way uploaded/or cancelled)."
706,"To check this, if I manually click the 'refresh' icon on top-right corner, it gives a warning message which is really doesn't help the user what his/her action should be."
707,Not worth the hassle This crazy app isn't even compatible with itself.
708,"Go ahead and try it,  use the evernote clipper on a PC to save a Bookmark to whatever page on the Web you like,  then open the newly created note on an Android device, you can't edit properly because the note contains unsupported formating."
709,Seriously?
710,What kind of crazy app doesn't recognize itself.
711,Update.
712,The Clipper has ruined evernote.
713,I have dozens of notes with clip  failed and I can't delete those.
714,They've been stuck like that for months.
715,It worked fine before.
716,Some notes I've had to clip and reclip several times  before they would work.
717,I'm going to spend the next year transferring my  notes to somewhere else so I don't pay next year.
718,"If this is how they treat  paying customers and ignore emails, what's the point?"
719,"When I scroll down to  next note, I suddenly end up in 2012 and have to scroll all the way back to  the present."
720,It's getting irritating.
721,It's become an extension of my brain.
722,"I have it on my phone, tablet n computers."
723,Syncing is one of the best  features.
724,"To get full use, use more tags and less notebooks."
725,I use it for  lectures.
726,Only wish i could upload bigger audio files as i tape my  lectures.
727,Maybe Evernote Academic?
728,Black screen!
729,help!
730,One of my favourite apps!
731,But after flashing a new ROM on my device and installing the Evernote App - the program is not accessible.
732,After starting the app the screen become white for 10 sec.
733,and then becomes black.
734,(on the screen the status bar is visible only.)
735,And after that - nothing.
736,I'm able to log in in the Evernote for HTC section and my account seems to be Synchronised.
737,But when I try starting the app - the screen remains black.
738,Please solve.
739,My account is OK on web site and all the other apps on my device runs normally.
740,I think I might be done with evernote and looking for an alternative.
741,It has always been very okay--even with a paid subscription.
742,It was the only option.
743,But I've had a problem the entire time I've used it.
744,"If I use evernote across all of my devices (the only reason I use it) it constantly happens that an older version of a note on one device will sync as the most recent version, even though that device hasn't been synced in days."
745,I lose days of information.
746,"If I have it on my computer and I didn't close it out and my computer is in sleep mode for a weekend and I've been using it on my phone throughout the weekend and I return to the computer and wake it up, that version of the notes syncs up and screws me out of the entire weekend's worth of data and updates."
747,What kind of idiot programming allows it to think a note that hasn't been updated in two days on one device should override a note that has been constant use on another device.
748,And why hasn't this been issue been dealt with after lord knows how many years evernote has been going.
749,If your data is important and you are a regular user.
750,Look for something else.
751,I am.
752,I'm so fed up I could spit.
753,While I'm at it.
754,The formatting is a crazy person.
755,I can change the formatting for the whole note and then I'll delete a line and the formatting for everything after that will revert back to a previous formatting.
756,Sometimes I'll be making a list and every line will be a larger font.
757,It's seriously like the damn thing is drunk.
758,It doesn't matter what device I use.
759,It has always been an idiosyncracy I put up with because I didn't want to have to find something better.
760,Previously I loved the app.
761,"It was a perfect note saving app for me because whenever I needed to save any data, journal, articles, or any type of notes."
762,I used to just share and save it on Evernote.
763,"And I used to get exactly what was available on the site, exact view and same paragraph, same font, same line, same pic, etc."
764,"But now from last two updates Evernote has disappointed me again and again because whenever I share and save a note, it's(note's) view is totally compromised."
765,"No titles, no subtitles, no highlighted or important points or topics which are mentioned in site as it is."
766,Everything is saved as just plain text.
767,"And in order to rearrange the note as it is on the site, I have to highlight what was already given on the website, which consumes my most of the time to organize the note!"
768,What happened guys?
769,"Already ""Simplify formatting"" feature was there."
770,Now you have complicated the whole app for me.
771,Now I'm searching for another app which can save my data as it is available like the previous versions of Evernote used to do.
772,Last fourth version was better.
773,The update to the new format has made this app practically unusable.
774,I mostly use it to save and organize content from online and other apps.
775,"Now that the overlay widget is gone and you're taken into the app itself, it's much less functional and shows off all your other saved notes at the same time."
776,Who needs privacy anyway!
777,"/s You also can't add tags on the fly, so if you want a new tag for something you're saving, too bad, you'll have to go back in and edit the note later."
778,Pass on this app.
779,It's worse sorry Since the last update I can't use my regular photo viewer to choose pictures from my post.
780,I now have a list of images that seem to come from my tablet but not it's sd card; where all my images are.
781,"I have around 30,000 images in various picture folders (I am travelling and have a 128GB sd card in my tablet where my images are stored)  and this update to 3.9 has made choosing images impossible."
782,I have two possible workarounds.
783,Either I upload the images to google or similar and put a link in the post to them.
784,Or my second option is to upload the images in the WordPress app through the media menu item and then choose these images I want in the post using your new chooser interface.
785,Honestly I see what you are trying to do with the new interface but it does limit the user as to how they choose their images.
786,"Handing this task over to the operating system, as it was before, makes more sense and makes your app lighter."
787,Please switch back to the normal way of adding images.
788,Updating posts on tablets and phones has been great with the WordPress app and I feel it's just been made more difficult with this update.
789,Free version crippled.
790,Paid version too expensive for value.
791,"Since Evernote crippled the free version, it's easy to switch to OneNote (my recommendation.)"
792,"Simply Google search ""switching from Evernote to OneNote"" in Google and it's the first page listed."
793,A tool was created to help you migrate.
794,OneNote free tier is far superior and for $100/year you get so much more including full Office apps and 1 TB of space for OneDrive.
795,"Whether your a paid user of Evernote or not, you're a fool to stay with them!"
796,Lots of room to improve - The bullet point feature is buggy - The offline feature is buggy - Does not offer start screen customization.
797,"It always open with all notes in a flat view  - No password protection per folder,  only for the whole app - Pictures are not attached in line so that you can comment on them and in context with the rest of the note - No font customization - No manual notebook sorting  - No default view/sort option per folder,  only for the whole app - No ability to include notes with tables."
798,More material design please.
799,"Still I don't like the icons for both the app itself and those inside the drawer, in this material design interface they're the most distracting parts."
800,"The font isn't good either, especially when you have 2 different fonts just inside the drawer, and with different capitalization."
801,I can still never find a way to use the settings and change my default notebook when sharing from browsers or create a new note.
802,I have to mention that the password interface is very UGLY!
803,"Great viewer, horrible editor While viewing functionality and searching is on par with the Evernote desktop app, the Android app is riddled with editing problems, like (1) deletes spaces between words when you open for editing, (2) ""HTML"" notes with font family/size changes, justification, rules can only be edited ONE LINE at a time, (3) bold, underline, italics randomly activate or won't turn off/on, (4) navigation with Dpad or keyboard arrows is buggy, skipping lines, not wrapping, etc."
804,"Many more editing errors make entering notes a frustrating endeavor, but as a viewer for Evernote, it's great."
805,Would be nice to have ability to save url like in Google Keep.
806,E.g note title should have site page title and content of note is just url with pic.
807,Edit.
808,Thanks for that.
809,What about separated tags that exist only for a certain notebook.
810,It would help to separate work/personal etc notes and would simplify searching by tags when one has many.
811,Blatant internal storage hog.
812,"Each time the app is updated, it decides to fill up the internal phone storage, rather than the the SD card."
813,"And following an app update, you then MUST re-download ALL previously downloaded apps, and again, fill up the phone storage not the SD."
814,"At over half a Gigabyte of app and mapping data, this app is just blatantly greedy, and the developers are either too lazy or too incompetent to design an app appropriately to store directly on exterior SD card storage."
815,----------- WHY do I have to download maps again following app update?
816,EDIT: why also the need to automatically start up at boot?
817,"This app is getting very tiresome to use - weekly updates, repeatedly having to download all previous map files after every app update, frequent nag screens."
818,"Just develop a simple app - which works properly, doesn't nag its users, and doesn't gobble up huge amounts of data!"
819,This app has helped me many ways.
820,It's like having a notepad with me.
821,"Took awhile to get used to it, switching from pen & pad to typing everything now on my phone devise."
822,There are times that I miss my hand writing on my personal pocket calendars.
823,"The sad thing is this electronic record keeping, you can't look back on or reminisce like you can when to go through your memory box & find your past pocket calendars."
824,I really miss that.
825,"Anyways, thank you for this service."
826,"Nov 25, I uninstalled Evernote for temporary reasons from my Lenovo Android 5.0+, I've been going insane trying to reinstall this app."
827,"It shows up as installed in my app settings, but evernote's icon is no where to be found nor is there a widget like before."
828,"Went on to 3 different browsers, Chrome says this app is not compatible with my phone, windows, won't let me sign in."
829,What the hell is going on?
830,I've got alot of important things on this app!
831,!
832,Why are you doing this to me?
833,??
834,Please fix !
835,"Tonnes of fluff, but lacks some basic stuff... ... like the ability to delete a note, which has been requested for a bloody long time."
836,"In what universe does this ""feature"" count as an ""option"" that should be lower on the priority list of things to implement than things like... location tagging?"
837,"Do people enjoy accumulating a mountain of notes on their phone, only to have to log in via a browser to manage things?"
838,This basic action exists on the iOS and web versions of Evernote.
839,Independence of dev teams is a poor excuse for disparity of features.
840,"If this didn't come pre-installed on my devices, it'd be uninstalled right now."
841,"Syncs notes so I can share them between home, work and my phone."
842,"I use Evernote pretty heavily, and it does what I need it to, but it also has a few annoying problems."
843,"Syncing is at best every 5 minutes, so quite a few times I've finished a note on my laptop, shut down the laptop before it syncs, and then later on I can't find the note on my phone."
844,"You can tell Evernote to manually sync, but I really shouldn't have to remember."
845,"Syncing not being instant can also lead to ""conflicting changes"" between notes, even in cases where it really wouldn't be hard to merge the changes."
846,"The collaborative note stuff is also a bit silly in that one person editing the note ""locks"" the note so that no one else can edit it."
847,"The rich text formatting also occasionally bugs out completely, especially on a note with lots of formatting, and sometimes the only way to fix it is to remove the formatting and add it all back manually."
848,"The new ""Context"" feature is intrusive and keeps trying to turn itself back on after updates."
849,2 problems encountered 1.
850,Reminder setting is flawed.
851,The movable curve for setting time and wheel for setting date is not working and imo is totally redundant.
852,Manual inputs doesn't work either.
853,Time displays AM when i set it in PM 2.
854,"When creating a note about an upcoming event that im organising, i want to be able to include the location of the event."
855,"But when i select ""set location"", the app automatically search and pin my CURRENT location and worst, it uses the TITLE of the note as the name of my CURRENT location."
856,Pls fix.
857,So far I'm finding it very helpful and it's a great idea but the app for ui is hugely unintuitive and chunks of it seem not to work at all.
858,There are buttons that just look like explanatory text and other things that look like buttons that aren't.
859,"If I hatch a new pet or try to make a new change to my avatar it can sometimes take several minutes for the app to recognize and show the change, meanwhile I'm trying to figure out what I did wrong."
860,The entire party structure and invitation setup is needlessly complicated and frustrating.
861,The actual task/to do list setup is great.
862,That section of the app is what we're here for and it's really great.
863,The reward and group mechanics are good motivators.
864,It's just the structure of the game that needs improvement.
865,"Appalled at changes made when installing I don't believe that it was a coincidence that after installing Evernote on my Nexus 4, I discovered all my hotmail email was gone (forced a re-sync and it came back), then found that the gallery app had been hijacked - going into gallery started the camera, and the only albums I could access were my picasa ones."
866,Absolutely appalled - had to clear the data and cache associated with the gallery and restart phone - have deleted Evernote and won't be using it no matter how useful it could be.
867,How dare an app be set up to arbitarily change settings on other apps without informing the user and giving them the choice not to do it!
868,Crappy.
869,"Loyal user for a few years, this year my Plus subscription did not renew for some reason."
870,My devices had to be unsynced and I can no longer access my notes offline.
871,"Only option is to upgrade to Premium as you can no longer start a new Plus subscription, although it was supposed to have allowed the Plus to continue as long as I didn't cancel."
872,"But, no way to speak to anybody about it as you have to have a premium level in order to contact their help service."
873,Looking for a different app.
874,Unstable app.
875,Does not sync with other devices consistently.
876,Does not share notes and notebooks consistently.
877,"Shared notes do not generate Evernote or email notification to recipient, even though recipient receives emails from others and spam folder is empty."
878,Sharing has worked in the past.
879,"However, after yesterday's update, the only way to share notes today (11/04/2016) is by sending them as regular text emails, not Evernote link."
880,This app is not ready for prime time.
881,Unable to create account to start using app.
882,"Pop up message indicated I had a bad connection to the internet, however I was successfully connected to WiFi."
883,"I turned my phone and WiFi off and back on, but still got the same results."
884,I do not care about being able to access notes from anywhere.
885,I only want them on my phone.
886,"Consider making it an option to NOT create an account, especially if your app cannot adequately identify internet connections."
887,"Seems like it would be great, but it's a bit clunky & makes my phone freeze I was really excited about this app, I wish it worked better on my phone (Moto X 2nd Gen/ And."
888,"5.0) I have plenty of storage and RAM  available, not a real power user."
889,"It could be Lollipop's fault, it's not as great as it could be (preferred Kitkat), but Google lately seems to put the stranglehold on what should be basic features."
890,"Was trying to use EN to put together a rough idea for a photo book:  -When taking pics of handwritten notes either in Post-It or document format, they came out in varying positions; sideways, upside-down, etc."
891,"-One of the post-its actually had the yellow hue which was cool, but couldn't replicate that."
892,"-The photo ""tip"" in the middle of the screen continually pops up over the image I'm trying to capture (""I'm already using a contrasting background"", I said.)"
893,"-Camera starts glitching and freezing, and app freezes sometimes."
894,-Sometimes pics wouldn't transfer into a notebook once captured  After a half hour of trying to make it work right I just hung it up.
895,An app that freezes my phone goes to the uninstall pile.
896,"I'll check on it later, I've heard/read such great things about it."
897,"Disappointed right now Unfortunately, I have become too dependent on this app."
898,Apparently they are making everybody change their passwords.
899,I have been trying to do so and keep getting looped around to a message saying that they will send me an email.
900,The email says to click the link to reset my password.
901,I click the link and go through the steps and it loops me back to sending an email.
902,Then I got a message that said that I needed to contact their support because they can't identify me.
903,I've tried that twice and haven't received any response.
904,I can't sync any of my notes until this gets resolved.
905,If it takes more than a day I am switching to another notes program and starting over.
906,This is frustrating.
907,"Good thing it's free (marginally) When I added a photo to a note, the text disappeared."
908,"I tried restoring the note, checking conflict notes, and trash to come up empty handed."
909,"Have emailed support four times already, with only a generic response."
910,Tried to go premium as that was a suggestion to retrieve previous saves.
911,On four different devices including a desktop I was repeatedly informed by the screen that I had not entered my credit card information.
912,"I anticipate a lengthy communication session with my bank, behind Evernote's uselessness."
913,Love it!!
914,But.
915,I use this for pretty much *everything*...
916,"Web sites to revisit, a quick scratchpad, sorting and saving emails for offline access, to-do lists, and the list goes on."
917,"I love that I can access my Evernotes from my tablet or a PC, and that when I had to replace my phone last week, I didn't lose anything!"
918,SO WHY ONLY THREE STARS?
919,"I don't own a PC, and the app doesn't allow you to delete notebooks; nor can you access the desktop web site via a mobile device."
920,"When they fix it, five stars!"
921,(8/28/14)
922,"So so Decent app, but laking some basic options: font size, font type, alignment (justified), background color, possibility to add a new note to a new notebook when editing it (you can save it only to an existing notebook and move it to the desired notebook after you get out and create it) password protection is a paid option."
923,"It is intuitive and easy to use and it has two levels of folders (notebooks and staks), that helps alot in organizing."
924,The sync works fast and without problems.
925,20161104: Lost encrypted data - 1 star!
926,"The synced note taking, collaborating system evernote provides is extremely useful."
927,However it's been a long road to where it currently is for the andoid app and let's not mention the war (linux).
928,Android app still lacks many features the Windows PC version supports.
929,"For instance, tabs?"
930,Tables?
931,Coloured text?
932,Reversed sort ordering?
933,"Most features that aren't supported I have to refuse to use because I can't make my notes look how I want, or if I edit on Android a note made with formatting on Windows it will royally !screw!"
934,the formatting up after saving on Android.
935,20160505: Skitch support dropped Jan 2016.
936,Can't get Skitch from Play Store.
937,No readily available info on where to get it.
938,Dropping to 2 stars.
939,20161104: Website version LOST my encrypted data - heavily inconvenient!
940,"The website reported some generic issue, possibly maintenance then when I reloaded the data was gone."
941,"That's ok, I have premium."
942,NOPE!!!
943,Don't have a windows PC at the moment so NO FILE HISTORY FOR ME!
944,1.
945,Losing data.
946,2.
947,Losing _encrypted_ data!
948,3.
949,Paid feature unusable on 2 out of 3 platforms!!!
950,1 star Evernote.
951,1 star.
952,It will take _everything_ to change from 1 star.
953,Including a Linux version.
954,"After 3 years of reliability, today one of the contents of my notes was missing."
955,Blank.
956,It's not in the trash.
957,It's not obtainable on web.
958,Gone.
959,"Don't call me petty, but even one note is VERY important and this particular one was to me."
960,So to have it suddenly gone missing with no backup is a major let-down.
961,2000 words of hard work gone.
962,"It may seem little, but once again when you've got a dateline to meet it's a lot."
963,"I repeat, a LET-DOWN."
964,"FUTHERMORE, there is no 'help' page in the app that would allow me to send an error report as mentioned on their help site."
965,THE ADVICE YOU'RE GIVING EVERYBODY IS THE SAME.
966,DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT.
967,Thanks for nothing.
968,UNTRUSTWORTHY APPLICATION.
969,This app was the best app on my device since last 30 months uptil last update in Dec. 18.
970,It seems app develoers hv upgraded it for latest ver of android devices.
971,(I am still using 5.0.1 ver).
972,I hd same issues with some other apps also.
973,But those dev have made changes n kept lower end devices compatibility with new features also.
974,This seems possible in designing n coding an app.
975,(Problem is with basic text note view n edit format).
976,Hope Evernote is also back for lower end devices.
977,"This is my second time returning, and after a 2 year hiatus, I'm pleased to say that everything I hated about this app is still there and nothing new has really changed."
978,It's so buggy and I can't get any help on any of the bugs I experience.
979,Like the fact that I don't do any damage when my cron rolls over.
980,Yea… I get no response from the developers.
981,The only reason I use this app is for the sake of quests?
982,Because everything else is so boring.
983,But even the quests are dull.
984,"And if you're in a big party, they don't even scale it properly?"
985,There's nothing like having a quest start and then having it finish a couple hours later before you even have a chance to do anything.
986,Not to mention it totally lacks the ability remind you of anything.
987,All it does is nag you everyday at a set time.
988,That's all it's capable of.
989,Set a to do with a due date?
990,Great but you won't get a reminder about it.
991,Not to mention the fact that it still doesn't allow any form of offline capabilities.
992,And they just make up excuses for why they can't have it.
993,Which I don't buy because I've used other apps like this where I can go offline and use it.
994,Its slow as hell.
995,And for forcing me to be connected to the internet it doesn't even notify me of new posts from my guilds and party.
996,I keep all kinds of lists on evernote and recipes from the internet.
997,It's as easy way to copy and paste them into one location.
998,It also makes it easy to share them later.
999,Update 1/4/20: the app is no longer working after you try to create a new note and add one word of text.
1000,Update February 2020: app still isn't working correctly even after reinstalling again.
1001,I have since removed from my phone and looking for another note app option.
1002,"great features BUT ... i love the features (great widget, compatibility with Skitch etc) - they're great for my Note II, and make for a great SNote (app) replacement  BUT - there are some issues."
1003,"my number one problem is the lack of accessibility - can't batch delete notes, not to mention it's cumbersome still to delete them one by one (open...menu...scroll down... delete)."
1004,"also, the user interface isn't (imo) suitable for dealing with a large number of notes (i.e."
1005,"folders/notebooks, etc)  i wouldn't mind those inconsistencies, but this app IS buggy on my Note II - for example, when I move my cursor to a different word/different part of my text to edit that word/part, the editing gets done on my /original spot/ i.e."
1006,the spot i move my cursor FROM.
1007,"the only way i can move my cursor to edit text is by using the arrows built into my Swype keyboard, which is inadequate for long notes  i wish i could like this app, so i hope these issues get looked into... :)"
1008,"EDIT: I haven't transferred everything to OneNote so I still use Evernote to view some notes but (1) and (2) haven't been resolved, and I'm not sure about (3) because I no longer edit notes or create new notes using the app."
1009,Props to the dev for responding and offering a solution though.
1010,ORIGINAL REVIEW: Used to be really great on my Samsung S7.
1011,"But on my Mate 10 Pro, it was just really really hard to use."
1012,"(1) If I'm not using the default font, icons just show up as random letters, I wouldn't know what I was tapping if I wasn't using it before, (2) My notes look chaotic, font sizes vary throughout the note even when everything's in default and (3) I've never had problems with my keyboard using different apps but typing in Evernote was so frustrating."
1013,It keeps overwriting stuff that I'm writing with something I've typed in the same note randomly.
1014,I delete and try to type it again and it just keeps overwriting stuff that I'm writing and I can never finish anything.
1015,So I'm finally going to replace this with OneNote which I found to have a simpler interface and easier editing options in mobile.
1016,"Useful, but slow Evernote allows you to enter notes from a computer, smartphone or tablet, and even by email, and access it from any device with an Internet connection."
1017,Notes can be tagged and searched speed up sorting through all the data you will wind up generating.
1018,"This is all very good, but the downside is that performance on Android seems very slow, and it can take many seconds for a note to load up."
1019,"I suspect that no information is stored on the device, with everything being downloaded off the internet each time."
1020,this app is an absolute rubbish.
1021,the new update is real catastrophe.
1022,the settings go back to default each time and the app loses the address for map storage files which results in asking to download the map data again.
1023,i had bookmarked the location of my hotel but then when i was in Spain it failed show me even the downloaded maps.
1024,just rubbish.
1025,Awesome just wish the free version allowed connection to more than two devices.
1026,3 perhaps?
1027,Edit...
1028,Reluctantly changing my rating.
1029,I have the same typing/editing issues as everyone else since the new update.
1030,"I can forgive almost all the other quirks except the fact that when I type a word (and Evernote causes my keyboard to get it wrong) and I backspace, it doesn't delete the entire word, and I have to go thru and delete the entire word manually, no matter what long, nonsensical word Evernote has decided to put in for me."
1031,Backspacing then runs the risk of creating more issues if it decides to keep going crazy.
1032,This frustrates me to no end.
1033,It runs the flow of writing and thinking.
1034,"If it wasn't for all my current notes, I would have already switched to something else."
1035,"I really, really don't want to, because the app is perfect for me and my needs."
1036,Please fix.
1037,I have downloaded another note app.
1038,"It feels like I'm cheating, like I'm a betrayer."
1039,It feels dirty.
1040,"I don't want to learn a whole new system and go thru transferring all my notes, but i will."
1041,Please fix the typing issues so i can change my rating back to where it belongs.
1042,"New bug When creating a new text note, the options pane on the bottom is missing, not allowing me to change to bold, underline, add checklists, bullet points, etc."
1043,"The only way I can create these types of notes is to use the ""Explore Evernote"" from the home page left pane, then scroll to ""Start a checklist"" and then the bottom pane appears."
1044,"This may have something to do with my keyboard auto-loading when I try to make a new note, as it does not when I go the ""Start a new..."" route."
1045,"Gallery creation/modification missing, Nexus 4 video upload doesn't work	On the whole, the UI is clear and nicely built, but two basics things I use most are missing/not working: - Creating a gallery necessitates first googling the workaround in their support forums (i.e."
1046,"(1) attach multiple photos, (2) save as draft; this uploads images and links them to this post, (3) edit post replacing all code with just [gallery]; this uses all linked images (4) publish) - editing a gallery is impossible (just recreate using workaround) - uploading videos on my device doesn't work (invalid file type error), nor does the ""quick video"" function (can not retrieve media)"
1047,This app has gone downhill.
1048,Now that Google maps supports offline maps there is absolutely no reason to use this app.
1049,It still causes my device to restart.
1050,"No other app makes my phone restart, only this one."
1051,It uses a dodgy background process that makes my phone restart even after I finish using app.
1052,"They need to add a ""exit"" button to properly close the app."
1053,It keeps running services in background even when I force quit the app via task manager.
1054,It crams a lot of junk and annoyances in the app.
1055,I don't want business names or the ability to rate or share or whatever other junk they force in there.
1056,Let me turn all the junk off so I can use the map like a map.
1057,Stop asking me to turn on location settings.
1058,"I use offline maps and not interested in going online and ""writing a review"" of map locations."
1059,"So hears my review While sharing something to evernote, I have to click this and then that just to select which notebook I want to save it to otherwise it automatically saves into the wrong notebook."
1060,"Also while saving my recipes, half of the ones do not show its picture and there is no option of deleting the picture and manually adding one for myself ."
1061,Another thing that annoys me is you cant click on the back button to go on to the previous page you was on and instead goes of the app.
1062,Also can't add recipes from web page &gt;:(
1063,Arbitrary update ruined this app.
1064,I used to love this app until you made the home screen widget utterly useless to me.
1065,One of the main reasons I used Evernote was to create lists for myself and display them on my home screen so I would not forget or ignore the tasks I set myself throughout the day.
1066,Being able to organise my notes and notebooks in one app was just the icing on top of the cake.
1067,"I have switched to Google Keep for these things now and, although I actually prefer Evernote, at least Keep has a decent widget."
1068,"When you open the app it shows all of your notes in order of either ""recently added"", ""date created"", ""title"", or ""notebook."""
1069,"No option to organize notes by reminder date, or to drag and re-order your notes."
1070,"If you like to set reminders for yourself a few months in advance, then this app is basically unusable."
1071,"You can see everything in order of due date in a simplified drop-down menu if you click the ""reminders"" tab, but it's not enough."
1072,*Edit* This was downloaded on a Google Pixel 2
1073,"I tried send a file from (Google keep) to evernote, every file if content : yahoo or Google and login or password these kind of words, will be changed to yahoo online news or advertising in my evernote , it's really make me worry about this app it's safe to save my files ??!!"
1074,"Before was not like this, it's happened again after software updated 9/19/2018."
1075,"I tried to emails their support, got no answer, only got email ask me to upgrade my account."
1076,"Good, but not exactly what I'm looking for."
1077,I use this for note-taking in college classes.
1078,I'll start with the good: Love that I can use this on multiple devices and still access the same notes.
1079,The interface is much friendlier than others I have tried.
1080,I like how I can insert pictures and drawings as I go.
1081,Notes are also easy to share.
1082,I also sometimes use this to make to do lists.
1083,"The app encourages its use for all aspects of life, but to truly do that better for me it would need..."
1084,"Here's what's lacking for me: When I'm in a lecture class that I would like to record, the record function only works if I do not use any other insertable feature such as taking a picture or drawing a diagram."
1085,I can only do one at a time.
1086,I have had to download a separate app for recording an entire lecture nonstop.
1087,"When I share the notes, they really only look great if the reciever also has Evernote (which I know is the ultimate point); however, I take notes as an on-campus job and when I email a note, the format looks ridiculous."
1088,The font is at about size pt 4 and the drawings are scaled to be absolutely enormous.
1089,"And when I want to print the notes out, there are huge side margins that print in gray."
1090,Total waste of paper and ink.
1091,Great Potential I preface this comment with the acknowledgement of my organizational dysfunctionality.
1092,"While I believe this app may provide significant component for bringing some order to the chaos between my ears, there are some issue which are inhibiting and irritating."
1093,"First, and possibly most important, I have yet to discover a method of offering feedback to the developers, hence this review."
1094,"The most frustrating feature missing for me right now is the ability to change the default view in the computer based app, it always defaults to ""Created"" (date) and ""Revers Sort Order"", I do not think that way; I need to specify my preferred view (""Notes by Title"" Ascending)."
1095,"I also find it frustrating to not be able to add ""Tags"" from my phone."
1096,"Nonetheless, I do think this app has great potential and possibility and commend the developer(s) for offering such a rich version as a free app."
1097,It is my intention to switch to the paid version once I can see how (if?)
1098,it will work for me.
1099,I've been an Evernote user for years.
1100,"Still a strong supporter, despite the focus in the last year or two on Evernote for business rather than Evernote for individuals."
1101,"The good: access your notes, choose which ones are accessible offline, fairly easy access to Evernote features despite being on a mobile device."
1102,The bad: No in-app PDF support.
1103,"Would love to be able to see PDFs in-line in my notes and viewable full screen, without having to download the PDF and open in another app (which often creates another copy of the PDF file)."
1104,You end up with PDFs all over your phone wasting space.
1105,When is bar widget coming back?
1106,10/13/15 UPDATE-- Now BAR widget is gone from my tablet screen.
1107,Not happy.
1108,I really depended on that Bar widget to keep me on track.
1109,( 9/28/15 review --I take it back.
1110,What happened to BAR widget?
1111,And why do you have to perform 2 steps to get note to appear on homescreen?
1112,Used to be able to set reminder from inside note when creating note.
1113,BAR widget still shows up on tablet but note disappeared from home screen of phone.
1114,Only single action widget available.)
1115,Has some UI usability issues.
1116,"While doing a search on a street, it's very unresponsive when I press on the street that has already come up in the search results."
1117,"Also, no way to enter a street number."
1118,Which seems pretty basic and shocking that it doesn't allow user to specify a street number!
1119,Disappointing.
1120,I just spent 20 minutes trying to enter in the address of a location.
1121,"Suggest you hire some UI designers and product managers to do a better job redesigning this app, to be user friendly and make it easy for users to do simple things, like actually entering in an address!"
1122,"In response to Developer's ""fixing"" the 2 missing EXAMPLE addresses I listed, that's like a drop  in the ocean."
1123,The problem is NOT simply that it couldn't locate the 2 EXAMPLE addresses I listed.
1124,The problem is deeper.
1125,"It was unable to properly locate an arbitrary, VALID, address."
1126,This is something Google Maps can do EASILY.
1127,"Based on this rather GLARING defect, I think this largely makes this app unusable for general purpose navigation.."
1128,Error when uploading imagen to post The media item could not be retrieved.
1129,"Error when uploading imagen to post.WordPress Android version: 4.5.2 Android device name: LGE Nexus 5  01 - Configuring Simperium 02 - Already registered for GCM 03 - resetting suggestion tables 04 - reader post list &gt; restoring instance state 05 - reader post list &gt; creating post adapter 06 - reader post list &gt; purging database 07 - reader post list &gt; updating current user 08 - reader post list &gt; updating tags and blogs 09 - trackLastActivity, activityId: My Site 10 -"
1130,"I have used this app from the beginning, and I have been through all the bugs and fixes."
1131,"I was recently taking handwritten notes, and in the 6th hour, the entire note disappeared and reverted to a note for typing."
1132,"The page had not cleared, and my stlylus was no where near the eraser."
1133,There was no undo/back button.
1134,"I started a new note, and the same thing happened a few minutes later."
1135,I logged into different devices.
1136,Nothing worked.
1137,Reached out to tech support and no one is helping.
1138,Uninstalling.
1139,"Hit the data limit and needed to upgrade, and was given no option to do so - the mobile app loads a blank screen, the desktop app loads a web page, and the web page tells me in fine print to go dig through my settings in Apple Music (which I never use)."
1140,I finally found this obscure menu and paid to upgrade but Evernote still thinks I'm on Plus.
1141,Please make it easier for me to give you money so I can move on with my night.
1142,This issue still hasn't been fixed.
1143,Useful App This is a useful app especially because I am able to upload my notes from my Write  Scribe pen directly into Evernote.
1144,In designing the user interface they decieded to try for cool instead of practical.
1145,I need a place to track information about clients.
1146,"Some of the information is repetative, some is unique meeting notes."
1147,"I need a place to keep website login information, user name; passwords; etc, these go in as seperate notes and can not (at least I have not found a way) to group them together."
1148,Meeting notes are another area...all lumped in by date.
1149,Action lists...all lumped in by date.
1150,"So, it is a useful app but not practical."
1151,"Does what it says for the most part, but Took 2 star away for the following 2 reasons: 1) The new way the save funtion is being implemented."
1152,"Use to be if u typed something in ur note & used the back button, it would save whatever u wrote AUTOMATICALLY & BEFORE going back to the main menu."
1153,"Since the last 2-3 updates however, one has to physically hit the done button to save ur wrk."
1154,2) Dont like that u cannot start editing a note by just clicking on it.
1155,"Now you need an additional step, click on the edit (pen) button at the bottom right."
1156,Y unnecessarily add steps when they are NOT NEEDED :(
1157,"Becomes extremely slow as file grows I keep adding to a couple of notes I use to list various activities I do, and as soon as a file is longer than a couple of pages it becomes frustratingly slow to edit."
1158,"Words take as much as 20 seconds to appear after typing them in, or just as long for letters to disappear when backspacing."
1159,"I once rated the app 5 star for all the incredible features, but now the simplest task of all, writing lines of text with the date and names of events I've recently attended, has become a near impossible one to complete."
1160,"Useful in many ways, but also frustrating."
1161,"There is much to like about evernote, particularly the fact that it is cloud based."
1162,"I don't recall having been so annoyed by it on the desktop, web, or my other devices."
1163,But I'm finding the android app on my new phone very frustrating.
1164,I can't get lists to function properly at all.
1165,"When in a list, pressing return should create a new list  item."
1166,This simply does not happen.
1167,Ever.
1168,"Also, there is no checklist option, like in the desktop application or web page."
1169,This is with the HTC One.
1170,"There should be a way to manage saved posts (sort them, put into collections, etc.)."
1171,"Moreover, the number of saved posts shouldn't be limited."
1172,"Actually the old ones don't get unsaved (when I view them on browser, then choose ""View in Reader"", the posts are still marked as ""Saved"") but they are not displayed in Saved posts so I can't access them offline (which is the reason I use the save function)."
1173,"And when visiting someone's blog, I prefer seeing an outline of their posts, which can help me access ANY post of that person, over an incomplete list of posts sorted chronically which doesn't display all of their posts (some of them are only accessible on the app through browser, so what's the point of using the app over browser?)"
1174,Introduces one to a world of interesting people.
1175,I like the app but wonder sometimes why WordPress suggests that I share posts on social media to increase views when I have done so to several sites the day before and had multiple comments and likes on those sites but WP shows me having less than one-third as many views or worse.
1176,People follow my blog or like a specific post but somehow there are no views that day.
1177,The notifications are useful but sometimes seem inaccurate.
1178,Habitica was very fun for a time... then I quickly became disengaged.
1179,None of my friends play so I was unable to go on quests.
1180,"Once I had equipment, a pet, and a mount I liked there was very little remaining to keep me engaged."
1181,I can't recommend using it single player.
1182,I am aware there are guilds to help you meet parties so you can adventure but I am disinclined to meet strangers just to keep my tasks organized.
1183,"Also I'll note that the penalties for not engaging in dailies are so minimal that I was never worried about skipping anything... and since the benefits are randomized (apparently heavily towards potion and foods, not eggs) I wasn't incentivized to try for any specific type of activity beyond things I just wanted to get done."
1184,"Just hate it... Not intuitive enough, I made couple of ""mistakes"" that got me headaches."
1185,"First one, I started a post, and I wanted to save it, so I pressed the arrow in the up corner to acces next options, but that icon is a ""paper airplane"" that publish the post without even ask!"
1186,"Alright, first use..."
1187,"I search for something like post adjustments (oh, they were in the footer!"
1188,"), and changed the post to local draft."
1189,But it NEVER went to draft again in the blog!.
1190,"Worst than that, I continued editing it, and the next time I accessed it, a message appeared, something like ""the post is not updated, do you want to?"""
1191,"and I thought of course, upload the changes, but what it did was download the first draft (the published one) overwriting the last one so I completely lost ALL of my work."
1192,"""Well, let's see the revisions..."" but there's NOTHING like that."
1193,"On top of all that, I searched the internet for help, and the only possible solution needed my device rooted before all this, and search some hidden directories, but it comes to happen that there are lots of people who doesn't even know what is to root an android device."
1194,ABSOLUTELY AWFUL!!
1195,!
1196,Don't download this nonsense!
1197,I wasn't told at sign up time that the app will no longer be free after 6 or 7 months or so.
1198,"So after that length of time of using it, Evernote wouldn't let me login and access my notes unless I pay £40 for one year, otherwise I should keep being locked out of my account and having no access to dozens my notes."
1199,"I should have chosen to use Google Keep which came naturally installed app on my phone but I didn't like that everything was based on Google, also same thing with my photos, non-existent music player and some other stuff we're based on Google too meaning no gallery app (blue and yellow flower icon) and had to download VLC as a music player making me feel like I was lacking basic essentials from my phone apps."
1200,"So I phoned HTC and they recommended Evernote, this is how I know this app."
1201,"I feel sorry for you if you're unemployed and you're using this app as a newbie, change your jotter provider quick before they rob you for your £40."
1202,I've never seen anything like this since when I started experimenting with different apps on modern phones.
1203,"Long time user, now just wastes time I picked up evernote when it was lovable."
1204,"As I remember it was ready to type the moment you opened, even started recording."
1205,Or at least was very easy to use in pressing situations.
1206,"Now, it wastes your time with extra clicks."
1207,"When I open a note and read it, I tend to want to add something- i have to get the edit button to appear, push it, and watch the whole document disappear while it scrolls way back to the top."
1208,"It also won't send a note to my email (the one used for login) because, you know, restrictions."
1209,Currently sharing to evernote from another app opens up the fullscreen evernote.
1210,"I wish it could just do a small box over the existing screen, where you could select your options like tags and notebook, without changing the active app."
1211,Google keep notes and Zoho notebook allow this.
1212,"If it were changed I would immediately get evernote premium, but right now it interferes too much with workflow"
1213,Update 12/23/15 As my free Samsung subscription I would have to wait until the first of the year to renew.
1214,"I used Evernote for all my notes, but pretty much disabled the other functions."
1215,"Then I found without a subscription, I couldn't access my notes without an Internet connection."
1216,"This is insane, what use is a note app that can't be used offline."
1217,I was never thrilled with the fact I had to use my PC to empty the trash bin of a mobile app as it was (they have it so Android devices can't access the web app).
1218,I have also had problems with the PC app.
1219,"I installed the Metro version of the app on my Windows 10 PC, not knowing their was a legacy version of Evernote."
1220,"Even after uninstalling the Metro version with a registry clean, the legacy version refused to install claiming only one version was allowed per user."
1221,Even working with Evernote tech support (who spent a lot of time assisting me) the problem couldn't be resolved.
1222,"For the last few months of my premium service I had some problems accessing notes offline, which was annoying."
1223,I decided to go another route for the future.
1224,"Instead of paying $40 for a year of use, I purchased another note application for $3, that meets my needs."
1225,"Suddenly I am getting ""clip failed"" for any recipes I've been trying to save."
1226,I can't even save the page a first time like I've always done.
1227,And I can't delete notes because it says I don't have permission....and I'm the owner of the note!!
1228,Why has Evernote gone whacky suddenly?!?
1229,I rely on this app for everything and now I can't use it for its most important feature to me!
1230,"And I cannot find any ""help"" option."
1231,I can't even send error logs.
1232,So frustrated.
1233,Now I have to look for another app.
1234,And I pay for the premium version.
1235,What a waste!
1236,!
1237,"The app is great an all for notes, to do lists, and other work."
1238,"However, if I write stories, articles, etc., I can't save them to the SD card automatically."
1239,"And if I move them, well, they don't show up in the app."
1240,Frustrating to say the least.
1241,Then there's the fact of trying to delete check boxes and other formatting options.
1242,It's become very inconvenient that I've stopped using the formatting.
1243,I don't plan to upgrade to make it better.
1244,Evernote should be doing that themselves.
1245,My account was hacked and there were several logins from around the world.
1246,My username and password were displayed and my notes.
1247,The hackers left a note stating they want 400$ in exchange for my details back.
1248,When i tried to contact evernote support there were errors and no email to be found.
1249,I just want to delete this app and move on with my life.
1250,Never trusting an android nor this app ever again.
1251,Chances are i wont even get a response to this message as it is evident that there is no support.
1252,"Forced to switch from ""notepad"" to this When my HTC One ""upgraded"" it's O.S."
1253,it deleted all my notes and told me that it no longer uses notepad and used this app instead.
1254,A note app doesn't need to be as sophisticated as this one.
1255,Plus they send you daily emails and have an icon at all times in the notification bar.
1256,"Ever heard of the KISS method, evernote?"
1257,"I have a couple of issues with this app that will most likely result in me uninstalling it and looking for another note app, or going back to OneNote."
1258,1.
1259,"Words following a checkbox for some reason do not work with my keyboard auto suggest, meaning I have to spell each word correctly on this little mobile keyboard."
1260,Most things I write following a checkbox are only one word.
1261,Not sure if this is just a problem with my phone/keyboard app.
1262,2.
1263,The Android back button doesn't save my edits.
1264,I have to reach all the way to the top left to reach a tick.
1265,And even then that tick still leaves me looking at a note I just wrote... And I have to do another top left tap to get back to my notebook.
1266,But that could just be one press of the Android back button.
1267,Can't believe I'm saying this about a Microsoft product...
1268,But OneNote actually has a better user experience in the above two cases.
1269,Only the Web Clipper works reasonably - rest is untrustworthy.
1270,"Suffice to say that just before I started typing this, I fired a message from a reserve Evernote account (opened solely for this purpose) to the main one via Work Chat."
1271,"So far, the program has not seen fit to acknowledge that I have sent it something."
1272,"The PC version seems more reliable on this regard, but nevertheless Evernote is not very reliable and cannot handle version control especially when the note is shared."
1273,"Thus you keep getting Conflicting changes,and when someone tells you he has finished editing the note, the final version does not reflect immediately, so there's always a pang of doubt as to whether you are reading the right one."
1274,Untrustworthy for work purposes and right now I use it mostly because my boss does.
1275,"Bad ux Bad search, I have to scroll through a note to find results, cant search within one note."
1276,"If I do find what I'm looking for, I can't edit at that location, as soon as I hit the edit button (why you'd need a button to edit a note when thats basically all this program is for is beyond me), it takes me back to the top of the note."
1277,Terrible ux.
1278,"Evernote, you should take a minute and focus on the core experience of your mobile app, the desktop apps are far better."
1279,MALWARE APP!!!
1280,": IT SENDS YOU VIRUSES AND SPAMWARE Y 30 DIFFERENTE LANGUAGES, THE ANTIVIRUS DETECTS IT AS MALWARE, STAY AWAY!!!"
1281,REPORTED !!!
1282,I do not want popups asking me if I have thought about where I am going this weekend.
1283,Deleting it now.
1284,Remove this idiotic nonsense and I will reinstall and re-rate it.
1285,also: CRASHES CONSTANTLY WHEN GOING TO SETTINGS.
1286,no audio instructions for turn by turn navigation?
1287,offline search is poor.
1288,download of maps extremely slow.
1289,"Markers on map should be ordered by nearest to my location, etc."
1290,"Markers search is poor, they re all scrambled."
1291,Acceptable but not fantastic I'm an unwilling user---would much prefer to pay for a good OneNote app if only someone would develop one--but Evernote more or less gets the job done.
1292,It's great to be able to include photos.
1293,My three major gripes are 1) awful navigation.
1294,"It's really hard to get a good snapshot of your notes as a whole and how they're organized, or to move around between notes by navigating rather than searching."
1295,OneNote spoiled me.
1296,2) SERIOUS issues with saving and autosaving.
1297,"There's no warning message if you close a note without saving it, so it's really easy to lose your work."
1298,"Same is true if a refresh or save fails for some reason: the message appears only briefly, so if you miss it you can keep plugging away at notes that you'll never be able to save."
1299,"So save early and often, as if you were using a word processor from the early 90s."
1300,3) Fixed display size.
1301,"If there's a way to change the display size, I haven't found it."
1302,Happy squinting.
1303,Terrible image management This app is flat awful and unusable for a blog with images.
1304,First you have to insert a photo into a post to get it into your media library.
1305,Then you have to select the same photo to be the featured image.
1306,BUT then the post will show the SAME photo twice!
1307,So you have to delete the photo from the post and leave it as the featured image for the post to look normal and not retarded.
1308,Would be a million times better if you could select a featured image from local library
1309,Guest Support Requires User Name...
1310,So I tried to contact Support using continue as Guest to ask the following question before trying out your products.
1311,"Just looking for an explanation why you'd need my exact location, contact list info, test access to protected storage, and especially the read your contacts and read call log bit."
1312,Is there a way to disable these features and what logic is behind you needing access to my contact and call log information for making note taking easier?
1313,"Just seems really sketchy to me, and from a lot of the comments I've seen I'm not the only one feeling this way."
1314,"Thanks,  'B"
1315,"Lost several large, detailed notes over the past year or more, help and support steps do not work (searching the trash, sending an activity log, can't email without subscription, etc.)."
1316,"You'll never hold my data hostage again because I'll never give it to you, again."
1317,Classic modern BS customer support of apps and poorly coded software with no avenue of actual help.
1318,I'm not a fan of Google docs but I'm going back to that because I've lost all my notes from this app.
1319,I did love this app until I had to reinstall due to my phone locking up.
1320,I am now unable to retrieve any of my notes.
1321,"It says it's due to too many devices connected and to upgrade to the pro version, I have and only ever have had one device connected which it shows in the settings."
1322,I have emailed customer services twice without a response.
1323,Such a shame but just not worth risking using as I have lost important information without any option to retrieve it.
1324,Not as integrative as I would hope Three things plague this app for me.
1325,"1-You cannot upload on the featured image button, you have to do that on the main screen of the site."
1326,"2-You cannot get the edit post link through the app, have to log into dashboard on a browser."
1327,I need these links to submit post to my editor through Slack or Trello.
1328,3-There is no word count visible.
1329,I need that since the sites I write for have a minimum word count.
1330,"All three of these would make this a five star app for me, else it is useless for me and I might as well just write through the browser."
1331,Audio problems!
1332,Why can't I listen to audio notes that I have made?
1333,"I just get a pop-up stating ""Note content could not be downloaded at this time."
1334,"Check your network connection and try again later""."
1335,Hasn't worked for weeks!
1336,"New ones work, but for long?"
1337,I was able to save & e-mail myself one and play on the computer.
1338,"I tried downloading evernote on my computer but can't start it (just in the browser, and can't play the audio files there anyway) and just encountered more useless problems that I have no idea how to fix..."
1339,"very buggy Using Verizon Samsung Note 3  tags created on android app do not sync to web app  edit note title - no way to save without editing note body as well  Web app (unrelated, I know) does not have pop-up descriptions for all buttons  Overall experience of Evernote is this: looks exciting, I like the whole idea, but easily the buggiest software system I've seen in years."
1340,Misses lots of posts ..
1341,The latest version's reader seems to miss random posts .. and only shows a handful of posts ..
1342,"I would have to check my email notifications, read the posts there, and if I need to comment I would need to go look for it .. very annoying and undermines the main purpose I installed the application for .."
1343,A little disappointed Was planning to use the apps for navigation in Osaka Japan.
1344,Paid for the pro function so that I can search for places.
1345,"However, I realized the map is mostly in Japanese (unlike Google Map)."
1346,The hotels that I've booked cannot be found using the search function.
1347,I supposed you would need to enter the hotel name in Japanese in order for the search to work.
1348,Google map works wonder using English.
1349,I wonder if I can get a refund.
1350,"Even without using the search function, the Osaka map is difficult to read (compared to Google Map) as it is mostly in Japanese."
1351,Update:  Found solution and more I wanted to download and sync Outlook notes to my Fascinate.
1352,I'm always creating notes.
1353,"Evernote does one better--I can mark an e-mail message to upload it to Evernote, and it is treated as a note on my Fascinate."
1354,Very useful for me!
1355,"For instance, I used to copy and paste info from an e-mail to an Outlook note, such as a hotel or car rental confirmation."
1356,That note would download to my old Palm.
1357,"Now I just mark the e-mail to upload to one of my Evernote notebooks, and it downloads to the Fascinate."
1358,Update:  Evernote seems to have stopped working on my Android.
1359,"It doesn't load, then I have to force-close it."
1360,I'll be uninstalling.
1361,"In Edit Note I need these Options , Kindly solve my issue 😠 When I save a txt note and then I try to edit it , the font change its color to white and get disappeared , then no matter what to do but the Note get clear."
1362,I've lost my note in the same way.
1363,"❌please give us options like you have given in iPhone📱(iOS), ⚫Options in iOS are  ✔Share ✔Present ✔Add Shortcut ✔Duplicate ✔Simplify Formatting ✔Delete ✔Cancel ..."
1364,I need these option in editing a note the most important option is❕Simply Formatting.
1365,The first mentioned problem is solvable with this option.
1366,This app is way to complicated and every task I try presents a new set of tasks that can't be completed in order to complete the first task!
1367,"I just want to take and edit notes,store in the cloud,access info with multiple cross reference....is that too much to ask?"
1368,"I used Evernote years ago and loved it,now I feel like I need a master's degree to navigate and make it work."
1369,Too much trouble.
1370,"Google Play Services has Stopped Every time I open this app, my Note 4 heats up and lags until I get a message saying Google play services has crashed."
1371,"Beyond that, I use this app to take handwritten notes, but the UI is terrible."
1372,"There's no simple way to center the canvas on screen, the arrows continually get in the way, and the zooming/scrolling never seems to work on the first try, preferring to detect only one finger and leave a giant streak in the note."
1373,"Last of all, please stop pushing Evernote ads into my device's notification menu."
1374,Grateful for this app and love how I can load media from phone direct to gallery.
1375,(pls allow access to the WP image gallery from the desktop version).
1376,Also Widget on stats is great.
1377,-Wish writing functionality was better.
1378,And on few occasions the App version threw off main version from Laptop.
1379,I had to rebuild post for hour.
1380,"(even now I see ""version conflict"" pls make way to disable)."
1381,"-Also ability to change appearance, widgets eg text, etc., would be great."
1382,Then a 4+5stars!
1383,Thanks WP Team.
1384,"Too many bugs Ecoing another user, the maps themselves are nice after they finally download."
1385,Love that I can view them offline and save data usage.
1386,Not much else appeals to me.
1387,The search results are odd and difficult to interpret.
1388,Voice commands never seem to work.
1389,"Once address is inputed, the route doesn't appear."
1390,You sit there showing current location only.
1391,I can't get miles to work as the setting defaults back to kilometers every time.
1392,"Fix the bugs, I love this app."
1393,"As it is, it's only good for offline map viewing."
1394,"Unintuitive I was using this app to walk around Munich, but it was often difficult-to-impossible to see the name of the street I was on."
1395,"I wanted to use it offline and without using my location (to save battery), but the app constantly prompted me to switch on location."
1396,"There's a bug in the bookmark view, it's difficult to edit the bookmark for items with a lot of details, it will snap to the bottom or top, and the ""edit"" button is in the middle."
1397,"Also, navigating the app in general is unintuitive."
1398,GPS Bug updated.
1399,Has GPS bugs that make it almost unusable.
1400,No voice Nav and regular google maps is much less of a battery drain  GPS bug is as follows.
1401,"You can search for a location, but if your GPS wasn't already enabled it will constantly search never making a connection."
1402,You have to stop the app restart it with GPS already enabled and it seems to work for the most part but it was very spotty and it makes it extremely hard to use if you don't have time to stop and park and occasionally I had to hit the lower left button to make it connect again if it stopped working.
1403,"Was very weird, never have this problem in most apps."
1404,I'm a developer myself that's the only reason I recognize it as a bug.
1405,Will give it two stars because it got me back from St. Louis without getting me totally lost.
1406,What a note taking app should do.
1407,"Taking notes on whatever device and sync them with all my other devices, is why I started using evernote."
1408,Now I have to pay for that.
1409,In itself that's fair enough.
1410,"However, I think evernote just isn't good enough to feel comfortable buying it."
1411,"The most annoying thing is that when you open it, it gives you the complete list of notes with a couple of hundred notes that's useless."
1412,So every single time you have to go to the notebooks list first.
1413,You should be able to set what  menu (or note even) you start with.
1414,And I hate the green colour.
1415,Custom colour schemes and coloured notes would be nice.
1416,So before I buy I'm going to check if there isn't a better alternative.
1417,"I'm a long-time premium Evernote user, but this new update is baffling."
1418,I like the consistent interface between devices and getting rid of features that added little to the user experience.
1419,But why get rid of right-click menus?
1420,And the ability to move tags/notebooks around by clicking and dragging?
1421,And customizing the tool bars?
1422,That seems like pretty standard stuff to have?
1423,"I'm finding it increasingly hard to justify the cost, so this is likely the year I'm switching to a less-pricey app."
1424,"Great app based on features, AWFUL due to bugs!"
1425,"Still using it daily, after restarting it several times, but the bugs are a huge drawback!"
1426,"Will change the review once I will be able to rearrange the tasks without having them moved back were they  were (or placed somewhere in-between), when it wouldn't crash when I set a notification on a task, when the party tabs don't appear on tasks view, and when the animals appear in the app when they are found, not hours later (refresh + app restart = no use in this case)."
1427,Conflicting Changes?
1428,"I was taking notes today, when everything I wrote suddenly disappeared."
1429,"I may have accidentally pressed a key to delete everything, but no undo button was available."
1430,"I checked to see if I could view the history, and saw that it was only available for premium users."
1431,I coughed up the five dollars and paid.
1432,"When I paid, my note in my notebook suddenly disappeared and went into a new notebook titled ""conflicting changes""."
1433,No note history was provided.
1434,"When I looked at eh recents and looked at the note history there, nothing was available."
1435,Extremely frustrating to loose hours and hours of work.
1436,"Not happy with the service either, receiving no reply from live customer service, which is considered a premium feature."
1437,EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING.
1438,"I do not recommend working with this program, as this could happen to others."
1439,"Until this is fixed, I recommend using Google Drive, where document revision history is free, and progress is saved every few seconds."
1440,DISSATISFIED CUSTOMER.
1441,"In this latest version, I notice that whenever I'm offline, it takes a long time for a note to show up."
1442,About a minute or longer.
1443,The app will just freeze with a blank page for a long time.
1444,Won't respond to back button.
1445,I have my entire notes library saved offline in my phone.
1446,"Note 9, Android 10."
1447,My older phone (Note Fe) using older version don't have this problem.
1448,"With each new version, you kept on removing functions and crippling the app."
1449,Are you forcing us to upgrade to even higher plan?
1450,Updated Feb 2020: what is wrong with Evernote?
1451,"Still freezes, note reopens while reading, crashes."
1452,The script monkeys that write this app are clearly not fit for the job & need to go back to kindergarten.
1453,Updated Dec 2017: crashes repeatedly all day long since app update end of Nov on Samsung s8.
1454,Previous review: Brilliant sync features between multiple devices.
1455,"Needs flags for filtering, & options for filters including ticked items to disappear."
1456,"Free Evernote account was great on devices, then on Google enabled Nokia smartphone became so slow unable to use (even tho' using SD card)."
1457,"Now, Free Evernote installed on my newer Nokia 3.4 smartphone."
1458,Went to create a new note (having disabled Location services across Google/Apps) and Evernote project a Location permission box.
1459,"I do not wish to Allow this, but can't get rid of this prompt!"
1460,"So, Evernote now unusable!"
1461,"Samsung Tab 7,0 This review was done after using the app to leave Atlanta airport."
1462,"**I do not recommend a buy on this app' but stick with the free version as the  major difference is the ability to search on this one, but it is not good and you essentially have the same features on both, free & Pro, with out it."
1463,"MapWithMe Pro has a nice mapping interface it works great on my 7.0, but *The app doesn't do navigation or street address search but merely shows you as a dot on a map which is the same as the free version."
1464,*The search feature add to the Pro version is very limited: not worth the money.
1465,"* The Samsung 7.0 comes with, Latitude, for free and gives you the ability to download maps for offline uses and work just as good."
1466,What I would like to see is point to point navigation and a more in depth search .
1467,If you drive into a GPS black out area a offline mapping system is nice to have limited uses to get you back on track.
1468,I've recently changed my note taking app and I'm really loving Evernote.
1469,I think that the price is very reasonable for what you get.
1470,However PLEASE developers can you include eye-friendly background like FT and Pocket are using?
1471,"Also, by browsing forums I realised that a lot of small, basic features, such as different marker colours, are missing."
1472,"This almost pushed me off making the transition and doesn't create a good image for the company, as it makes it seem like the developers are not listening to their customers."
1473,There is time for innovation and there is time for basic features.
1474,"Update: It turns out that EN has more issues that I thought - for example, desynchronised formatting between Web and desktop versions or a chance for a note's content to disappear."
1475,"Unfortunately, I can no longer recommend it because it will be a very frustrating experience."
1476,EN has a lot going for it but has more going against it.
1477,Shame.
1478,Sometimes deletes note content I initially gave this app a good review.
1479,"Although it does provide access to your Evernote notes, it will sometimes delete the content of notes when those notes were edited in the web client beforehand."
1480,Really sucks when you start checking things off on a todo list and then find all the content in that note disappear and no longer accessible from the mobile client.
1481,I seriously don't understand.
1482,The basic functions of the app are so janky and broken.
1483,"In the avatar creation, I had to keep pressing the options I wanted over and over for it to actually work, then when I finished the avatar had options I didn't pick."
1484,Every habit defaults to being both positive and negative.
1485,"I know there has to be some default, but it's kind of weird that if I have a positive habit I have to tap the negative button."
1486,"Adding tags is really clunky because the tags have to be added to the filter, (I guess it works but it's unintuitive to have to add a tag to the filter instead of just tagging the task itself) but when I add them they don't immediately get added."
1487,They disappear and then get added a few minutes later.
1488,Half the time it won't let me move around the tasks.
1489,Sometimes the FAQ text pops up overlaying whatever screen I'm on.
1490,"Switching between habits, dailies, to-dos, and rewards is finicky."
1491,"Sometimes swiping doesn't work, sometimes trading the icon doesn't work."
1492,I have to tap things in the equipment menu multiple times for them to work.
1493,Same for the avatar menu.
1494,"With patience all this stuff does eventually work, but it's tedious to just use the app."
1495,The app would be 10 times better just by fixing the buggy menus
1496,Evernotes been ok since I started using it 2 or 3 years back but it has suddenly decided to go completely buggy on me today.
1497,"I'm unable to create new notes, edit old ones."
1498,"Neither is it allowing me to edit /create (keeps stalling, freezing) not does it save when you try to exit a note."
1499,I just lost an important note to this.
1500,My attempt to uninstall and reinstall doesn't seem to have yielded much either.
1501,It was working just fine till two hours back.
1502,I'm using a Realme X phone.
1503,Kindly help plz
1504,"Cannot paste and only saves URLs - not helpful Was a huge evernote fan but am not happy with how it is behaving on my mobile pphone (Samsung S4 with Android 4.2.2 and Chrome browser)  --> Cannot paste text into a new notes, e.g."
1505,text that I copy from a word doc or the Internet.
1506,S I have to type everything.
1507,So unhelpful!
1508,--> Cannot save whole Internet pages - it saves only URLs when I use the share feature in my browser.
1509,Not great either - but this might be a setting issue - any hints?
1510,I really like you app Evernote.
1511,Disappointed you are limiting me to only 2 devices unless I upgrade my service.
1512,I never would have looked at OneNote or Google Keep - but you managed to find a way to make me look at your competitors.
1513,You can tell me that the web version is free - but much of what I do tends to be offline.
1514,I was just traveling without internet and was pleased I could update my offline lists to account for changes I didn't think of before my trip.
1515,But ultimately - I have been using this on my laptop/phone/tablet/and work PC.
1516,Each device provided a unique way for me to track and keep my notes organized as well as handy when needed.
1517,I'm sorry it ended this way.
1518,Maybe I'll use you again in the future if you change your ways.
1519,"Not  useful for sharing between PC and Android Evernote is good for keeping notes on an Android device, but what I needed was an application with which I could easily edit notes on my Android devices and on my PC at work."
1520,"At first it would seem like Evernote fits the bill, but it almost immediately falls flat."
1521,"After making small changes to two notes on my PC, those notes have now become uneditable from Android due to ""unsupported formatting""."
1522,"The reason given for the one is that it apparently contains ""web clips""."
1523,As far as I can tell it does not contain any web clips - I certainly didn't add any.
1524,The other note contains an indented list which is also not supported on Android.
1525,There is no option to remove the unsupported formatting.
1526,Not pleased with new look Lost some functionality with upgrade.
1527,"Tile view is gone (easier on my older eyes), editing a list is more obtuse (What You See is no longer What You Get until you exit edit mode), some functions now buried in hidden menus, and cloud printing from tablet no longer works."
1528,"Print utility captures a new ""upgrade to Premium"" popup instead of the body of the note."
1529,"Also, new ""cleaner"" display font is thinner and harder to read (again, older eyes )."
1530,Your desktop app threw my note away!
1531,"After suffering through an endless barrage of dialog box interruptions telling me my upload quantity was used up and asking me to go premium, I finished typing in the recipe I was creating and your app had the chutzpah to just discard the entire contents."
1532,"No local copy, nothing in the trash, it just vanished."
1533,Shame on you.
1534,"If I didn't have such an enormous investment of time in my note collection, I'd switch to another app and never look back!!"
1535,!
1536,Used to be the best map.
1537,"Great features, easy to use, but it has ONE MAJOR BUG that has been there for 2 years - they sometimes solve it, most of the time they mess it up."
1538,It is a very simple thing : the option to save maps to SD CARD.
1539,"Sometimes an update would relocate your maps to the phone, sometimes it would delete all maps, sometimes you had to uninstall and reinstall, sometimes ...."
1540,"This time they have surpassed it : it moved all my SD CARD maps to memory, filling it right up!!"
1541,And today there is no option to locate maps to SD CARD any more.
1542,2 years and they still can't get this simple but ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL feature to hold.
1543,"So, finally, I'm done and, guess what, in doing so, after trying 8 apps I have found an even better one :  HERE MAPS."
1544,Can't change Offline Map Location (Phone Memory to Sd Card)  How can I move maps to SD?
1545,"(for Android devices)     If you want to store downloaded maps on SD, you should move them directly from the app – open app’s settings > Map > Maps storage > select SD card."
1546,"If you don’t see Maps storage tab in app’s settings, turn off the device, take out SD card and put it back again, turn on the device."
1547,"If you moved the app itself to SD, move it back to the device storage."
1548,The app can no longer save web pages on Android It only saves the link to the webpage.
1549,Which is useless.
1550,Good thing I didn't subscribe otherwise it would have been a waste of money.
1551,"Old comments:  After turning on text underline, cannot turn it back off."
1552,"Tapping on the underline icon indicates that the underline is off, but it still shows when entering new text, even on the next line(s) underneath."
1553,"Restarting the app, creating a new document, and restarting the phone does not remove the underline."
1554,I love the app and have been using for a long time.
1555,"But a few days ago, I found an unidentified iPhone device synced with my account."
1556,I have no idea how long it had been synced and if and how the account was hacked.
1557,I removed that device from sync list.
1558,But have been trying to change my login password since.
1559,But I cannot find that option in the settings anywhere.
1560,Tried looking at the help page and it opens in Japanese!
1561,Seems to be a security breach.
1562,Plz rectify asap.
1563,New user interface sucks I am paying Evernote user and I must tell you: new user experience sucks.
1564,This is not facebook.
1565,I swipe to scroll not to reveal menu which lost half of items.
1566,My note list preview now shows half of first line of every note yet still leaves empty lines in between.
1567,Editor complains about unsupported formatting.
1568,Notes are shown with trimmed beginnings of every line.
1569,Dear developers:  Please send me email and I would send screenshots.
1570,Great app but .
1571,.
1572,.
1573,Easily gets note conflicts and now won't sync at all.
1574,I have 3 devices and all say system or network error.
1575,I tried deleting my phone as an approved device which meant I would just have to re-enter my password.
1576,But now Evernote says that I don't have a connection.
1577,"However my WiFi is working fine, thank you very much!"
1578,I believe these sync errors started with the recent upgrade.
1579,"I want apps that make my life easier, not waste my time!"
1580,"Stopped working on 1/25/2016 Just lost last few days of notes on my offline Android device, and unable to add new notes."
1581,Status page is showing everything as alright.
1582,"Evernote has completely lost my trust - how can you not keep a local cache of data, and not even show an error message when the sync fails?!"
1583,These were important and irreplaceable notes.
1584,1.
1585,"Password needs improvement in lock time, and you must add a lock button at the menu options."
1586,2.
1587,Fingerprint support.
1588,3.
1589,"New themes, specially dark ones, I am really tired of the green one."
1590,4.
1591,"If I copy from a note, and paste the info to the same/another note, the font size is changed automatically, and there's no way of changing font sizes on app."
1592,Gets worse.
1593,"Bloated, huge map files suddenly  etc Before you could download maps without the navigation."
1594,I love having a lot of maps of countries I'm not traveling to.
1595,"Same also for the traffic info, hotel bookings etc."
1596,I paid then for the pro version and I get trash.
1597,Pity as it used to be perfect!
1598,Now it gets stuck often is slow and buggy.
1599,Apart from it there is a persistent bug with search.
1600,I search a place and I get a point that I bookmarked before in the area instead of what I'm looking for.
1601,After a few tries suddenly it may give me the real place.
1602,"After multiple updated over the years, Evernote definitely is a lot more polished and feature rich than it used to be."
1603,But there are a few things that largely ruin the experience for me.
1604,1.
1605,Not having off-line availability of notes in a free version.
1606,This feature is bread and butter of note taking.
1607,"Not having notes available on demand, makes subscription almost a must, especially if used on non-mobile devices."
1608,There are other multi-platform note taking solutions available that offer this option free.
1609,2.
1610,"Continuous upsell of ""Upgrade you subscription"" type messages in push notification and in-app promos daily are starting to really bug me."
1611,"Even with free accounts, getting bombarded with ads is not something a respectable service should do in such relentless way that can't be opted-out of."
1612,It definitely should be a big NO-NO for paid accounts of any level.
1613,"Ok so when I use Google Keep I have my top 3 notes pinned, so don't have to look through app to find them, I open the Keep app and they are literally right there every single time, I mainly use this feature for my daily to do lists so I don't have to look for it every single time."
1614,In Evernote it seems like it shows most recent notes when you open the app.
1615,"They have a ""shortcuts"" feature however you have to go to the 3 line icon, click on ""shortcuts"" and then click on the note you want."
1616,"That completely defeats the purpose of having a shortcut, you might as well go to the tag or notebook you want right away."
1617,I really want to completely leave Keep for Evernote however the lack of this feature may be a deal breaker for me.
1618,"I'll still use Evernote for specific notes, however day to do day notes is simply quicker with Keep."
1619,They sync is slow.
1620,"I use the PC applications and for some reasons it hangs (long waits, not necessary crash)."
1621,I cannot do to many edits while syncing.
1622,I can now only use it for Housekeepings rather than reading.
1623,"I appreciate the technical complexity in the Evernote - for 100,000 notes I use there were 7 un sync able - and most of them were out of strange fonts when using the samsung pad written module , which i can understand."
1624,Alternative for reading evernote is the online login - don't every say its not useful - to search and read back.
1625,This has been fixed promptly.
1626,I was so embarassed when i showed a colleague how to use the evernote chat but it turns out i never received the shared page.
1627,Totally useless was their response.
1628,Need improvement.
1629,Almost usable Android app is pretty good.
1630,For win desktop the navigation and menus are misleading and hard to understand.
1631,After setting a reminder the date and time are hidden and only accessible if you choose the change menu.
1632,"After a successful sync confirmation the screen still shows the previous sync timestamp for a while,  a situation that could trigger the user to change data at the wrong time."
1633,Some messages are needed to advise the user when syncing is in progress because it takes several minutes leading to problem
1634,"Needs fixing This app was great on iPhone, but it lacks the efficiency and speed on android."
1635,"Why must I click to edit the note,  then click again to save it?!"
1636,Too many extra steps for something that is a productivity app.
1637,"Also,  where are pages of the colored file folders to flip through like on iphone?"
1638,Here we get just a plain long list which makes it much harder to find the notebook you're looking for.
1639,This version is also slower and clunky for adding / viewing photos; takes forever.
1640,This app needs work.
1641,Missing key features Been using this app for a few years and it is still lacking two significant features:  1.
1642,"No reminders: Evernote is a good app for making quick ""to do"" lists..."
1643,But it would be GREAT if you could set a reminders.
1644,2.
1645,Needs better text formatting: Evernote has very basic text formatting tools and they are kinda quirky.
1646,"Copy/paste from an email, web page or Word?"
1647,Forget it...
1648,The formatting is destroyed.
1649,These two enhancements would earn Evernote 5 stars in my book.
1650,CONS: - I paid for the app way back when you had to purchase it.
1651,"Some time later they made the app free but filled with ads, and now you have to buy subscription to remove the ads."
1652,This is the primary reason for 1 star rating.
1653,- Car navigation is so bad it's practically useless  PROS: - Good offline map support for when you visit countries where you have no service so long as you do not need navigation - Maps include hiking trails which is very useful if you're hiking national parks and you want to check where you are on the trail.
1654,The hiking trail maps are actually better than Google's.
1655,This app has turned into a continuous attempt at a money grab while completely disregarding what their users are asking for.
1656,"If you want to use Evernote for its high level features and are willing to pay for it, then you'll probably like it."
1657,"However, don't expect a widget because they inexplicably removed it, to the disappointment of many of their users."
1658,"And if you just want an app for quick note-taking with easily accessible and searchable notes, look elsewhere unless you plan to only use one device."
1659,The developers previously limited the basic (free) account to two devices.
1660,"Fine, that's understandable, if not annoying."
1661,"And you could still log in through a browser, but now a browser counts as a device, which is absurd."
1662,I assume a 1 device limitation is next.
1663,"It's clearly an attempt to force people into the premium plan at $8/month, which is just too much for those of us that just want the features in the basic plan but with more than one device, and they continue to not offer a lower priced plan that many would probably adopt just to have more devices."
1664,"For comparison, you can get a Microsoft 365 plan for $7/month, which gets you Office 365 and a TB of cloud storage."
1665,"Oh, and by the way, there's an Evernote to OneNote importer if you're looking to make a switch."
1666,I imagine there are for other note-taking platforms as well.
1667,Made me reset password 5x Evernote was cool a couple years ago but with no new changes in years seems blah.
1668,Plus this password reset thing made me not only change my password once but create a new one on every desktop and phone tablet because of how update was tooled.
1669,"If I wanted to keep using evernote, I would have had to create 5 new passwords and then after 5th, go back to other 4 and set sync pwd to whatever last device had."
1670,Every patch acts as if this is only device and makes you reset password even if you already did.
1671,Beware of data loss!
1672,The app for Android is just okay.
1673,"You can add images to a note, but can't specify where."
1674,You can't add notebooks or make other high-level changes (you need the web interface).
1675,For these reasons and more I'd give it no more than three stars any way.
1676,Why the 1 star?
1677,In my last sync I lost ALL NOTES created since the earlier sync.
1678,"On it with tech support, but no hope in sight."
1679,"I've since moved on to OI Notepad: basic but allows tags, works with OI File Manager, writes to SD, and needs no internet rights."
1680,Used to be great One of the recent updates broke the check box function.
1681,Accessing customer support through this app is impossible because they ask how they can help and you select an option from their list.
1682,"Then they ask to choose a topic, but there's no list to choose from."
1683,This used to be a great app.
1684,And from reading recent customer reviews I'm not the only one having issues.
1685,"Evernote, you better get you act together and send an update to fix these problems."
1686,Nerfed again!
1687,"Slowly but surely Evernote has been removing features from the free version (presentation mode, offline notebooks, etc), so it should really come as no surprise that they've sunk to the new low of making the free version essentially a ""trial version""; only allowing two devices when their mantra all along has been ""Sync your notes across all of your devices""."
1688,Thanks for the stick in the eye.
1689,Microsoft One Note here I come!
1690,"Very poor on nexus 5 App works very crappy on nexus   Fails to provide the most essential part.. Intuitive editing of notes..   Notes jump continuously back to top, can't be edited at all, app hangs, favorite's can't be accessed because the scroll bar gets in the way 9 out of 10 times..  Was happy and intensive  user - but currently can't use it decently on mobile device  Evernote .. Get your act together please"
1691,Evernote used to be excellent.
1692,"Recently, even after update, my notes get locked and kept having a message, ""This note is a text-only."
1693,"It was created in a different app."""
1694,This is not true.
1695,The note was created by me using my Evernote app on mobile phone.
1696,"Now these notes become useless, unable to edit."
1697,I have to copy all and paste it to a new note then delete the old one.
1698,A waste of time.
1699,The newest updates still had bug.
1700,"Since Evernote update version 8.2 above, cannot send/share image through Whatsapp, and cannot open the image sent ."
1701,(Open note that have picture file > select image > tap share button > choose Whatsapp > select contact > send > tap the file send > sender & receiver can't see the image files) On 8.1 version all works fine.
1702,Please fix.
1703,Thank You
1704,"DEC 2020 REVIEW: New version crashes when I try to take a photo with the app or try to attach a document and won't save any notes I write in my phone, even text notes."
1705,Had to uninstall.
1706,Please change the mobile app back to the old version until you're sure everything works.
1707,Thank you.
1708,OLD REVIEW: I don't know what I'd do without the desktop and android versions of Evernote!
1709,Love using Evernote and have been for years now.
1710,Just installed it on my Pixelbook and there are several things that make version of the app pretty unusable for me.
1711,"I use checkboxes a lot in my notes, but the current version of Evernote for the Pixelbook won't let me check the boxes."
1712,"I also really appreciated the tables functionality of the Mac version but this hasn't even got the option to make a table, let alone edit it."
1713,At the moment I'm getting by with the web version of Evernote when I'm using my Pixelbook but I really don't want to be
1714,"I have used evernote for a while now and may continue to use it, but unfortunately it seems that every update for Android comes with new bugs."
1715,"This time (June 5 update) a synching error message keeps on appearing, upon which the app suggests to ""see the original note""."
1716,"Well, the suggestion doesn't disappear ever and as a result the formatting features (I.e."
1717,"bolding, indentation, etc) are not accessible anymore - rendering the tool almost useless for clear note taking."
1718,please fix :)
1719,"UPDATE Thu May 23 2019: Sadly, downgradin from 3 to 2 stars."
1720,"OVER 11,000 note, CANNOT PRINT!"
1721,"SEVERAL GOOGLE SEARCHES re printing, worded differently, = ZERO SOLUTIONS."
1722,Super web clipper.
1723,"Evernote is a GREAT info repository, but NOT a useful tool."
1724,I've been a PAYING PREMIUM customer for years..
1725,HUNDREDS of DOLLARS.
1726,"I don't mind paying, but I DO MIND when the program won't perform a basic function, printing!"
1727,"ALSO, no in app help button"
1728,Works great between pc & smart phone.
1729,Problem saving--appends duplicate of check list to end of list each save.
1730,Cannot select past each check box to delete the duplicate entries.
1731,Makes the list function useless.
1732,Keeps telling me to upgrade for access to account on another phone.
1733,"They have not given me instructions on how to move my account to a new device, just an email telling me to upgrade for customer service!"
1734,One of the most problematic and difficult apps on my device....
1735,"This is even more unfortunate, since millions of users out there trust and use worpress - while this weak app is the only real smartpgone tool available to access your site."
1736,"After logging in relatively quick and smoothly, things start by looking promising."
1737,"But as soon as you start to try publishing or sharing media, the app starts bombarding error messages."
1738,I have already contacted support and forum - without an answer....
1739,"Logical Layout Needs Great Widget Important sync abilities allows  information to flow across multiple devices is great,  but who can't do that these days?"
1740,This feature actually is extremely useful and Evernote keeps it rather simple.
1741,"The ""layout"",  or structure,  behind the app is logical and therefore easy to use,  although it does not bode well for notes on the fly."
1742,"Developers, please make different Widget options."
1743,MUST create a widget to type directly  from/on/into Evernote from the homescreen -  this will facilitate quick note taking
1744,"Nice App Overall this is a great app, I have run into a strange and frustrating situation with my premium account."
1745,"I currently use the app on my tablet, my desktop, and my phone (all non-iOs) but what I have been finding is that when you make an edit on two devices before a sync occurs on either device, files get stored and when the syn finally occurs, they essentially crash."
1746,"This causes a note to duplicate within itself and results in an error message ""conflicting changes occured""."
1747,Pain.
1748,Otherwise a great app.
1749,"Ever since the block editor was introduced, editing images and aligning it the way I want it to be is tough on my phone and I have to rely on my laptop for it."
1750,"There's a particular layout I prefer and despite whatever tweaking I do, when the post is published, things aren't aesthetically how I want them to be."
1751,Earlier I had the freedom to just type stuff out and add images and publish it.
1752,Of course less options existed for formatting&alignment.
1753,The app is still quite user-friendly though.
1754,The recent update (v 10.4.4 build 458403 public; Editor: v112.1.14477; Service: v1.23.6) completely ruined what used to be a great app.
1755,It is completely broken and I would not recommend it to anyone.
1756,"Everything loads slower now, keyboard shortcuts are buggy at best, they decided to hide all the information like the number of notes within each tag, they changed the font color selector and now we're limited to 14 colors, all of which are super dull looking."
1757,"I don't have the time to describe all the new issues with tags, but I will say that they used to be integral to my Evernote filing system and now it is absolute garbage."
1758,0/10.
1759,I hate it here.
1760,"Cannot share notes I wanted to send a news article to evernote, not a lame link that will be broken tomorrow."
1761,Nope.
1762,"Well surely I can email it to myself as a reminder to download the article on my laptop and save it to evernote, right?"
1763,Haha!
1764,This POS will not send or let me add a comment...all I CAN do is add recipients - none of which will ever get anything.
1765,Neat.
1766,Going to start calling this Nevernote.
1767,Very disappointed.
1768,Inability to load notes when there is no internet connection if they had been updated (and there is no setting to turn on local storage) makes the app completely unreliable.
1769,"Also generally a very clunky app in tetms of UI: having to double tap to edit, have to scroll all the way up to the start of the note to tick to save, your screen jumping jerkily after selecting notebook, etc"
1770,"Mobile doesn't work When trying to edit a note on the mobile app for Samsung galaxy 3, all of the text is blanked out."
1771,"When trying to highlight text to see what has been typed, nothing shows."
1772,"There is no way to edit my notes, but I can type in new stuff and that will show just fine."
1773,"I've had no trouble with evernote on the computer, but I also tried the app on a Samsung galaxy ace phone and a google tablet and have the same blank text result."
1774,This has really been a downer for me because I don't always have computer access..
1775,"Too much sparkle I like having a notepad like evernote that saves everything across my devices, but there's too much going on in this app."
1776,Tons of weird menus and all sorts of flashy options that I'll never use.
1777,I miss when this application was just simple and meant for quickly taking notes.
1778,"I often find myself just using my phones text messaging application to leave my notes, instead of opening evernote and being annoyed with the startup menu."
1779,meh
1780,The app is fairly simple to use and it's great to have all my notes there regardless of what device I go on.
1781,"However, it would be great to have an option to view notebooks rather than all the notes at once."
1782,Sometimes I want to show something on a particular notebook without sharing the other notes.
1783,E.g.
1784,Showing new job applications when I'm just trying to show my bosses some new protocols.
1785,"I've researched this and apparently this is not s new request, Evernote just seems unresponsive to feedback"
1786,"I want to give it more stars because the site layout is nice and efficient, but editing posts is awful."
1787,The lag is absolutely unbearable.
1788,Trying to add a couple of characters takes 5-10 seconds to show up on screen.
1789,I've written part of a sentence and it's taken 30+ seconds to post them.
1790,Deleting them is even worse!
1791,I'm not even a fast typer on the text keyboard.
1792,It would be faster to handwrite everything at this point.
1793,Stick to the browser version for editing if this is why you want the app.
1794,The reader I mentioned the reader I meant I'm not able to view my site in-app.
1795,I like using this app even when there's issues but I'd love it if the reader returns.
1796,I do like the addition of searching for posts via keywords & hope that stays.
1797,An improvement would be if the posts related to the keyword(s) weren't in random order by date.
1798,"Also, I've noticed when I try to visit self-hosted sites it goes to their blog in-app it'd be nice if they were available to view in reader."
1799,It's mostly OK.
1800,This cannot fully replace the web dashboard.
1801,But I think it is OK as a mobile companion app.
1802,"You can do all basic tasks, like managing your blogs, notifications, comments, etc."
1803,with this app.
1804,I just wish it could upload multiple media files.
1805,A separate html mode in post editor would be very great.
1806,It also has upload problems from time to time.
1807,Would be great if those can be added/fixed :-)
1808,"While I can recommend Evernote for those who primarily clip web content using the Clipping tool, it is absolutely a productivity killer for those who want to create their own content."
1809,"Do NOT use it if want to keep a journal or take meeting notes, for instance."
1810,"I understand that Evernote does not want to get into the word processing business, but their editor is easily THE buggiest piece of software I have used in many many years."
1811,"The undo/redo feature frequently will not work ... you can get into a situation where it ""forgets"" what's in the clipboard and your previous version of the document."
1812,"It is a FREQUENT occurrence where you delete one character or paste in a small amount of text, and very strange things happen to the formatting of the note."
1813,The above-mentioned problems with undo only make this worse.
1814,And don't get me started about the bugs with the bullet points or tables.
1815,Frightening.
1816,Today was the last straw.
1817,I'm seeking alternatives.
1818,This app is fast going down hill!
1819,"Found replacement now,  swopping to Onenote its much better."
1820,This app is fast going down hill!!
1821,To many problems with it.
1822,"To list but a few, the 2 device limit now,  Bugs not being fixed, always had trouble with PC version not saving changes, and recently it will put loads of extra blank lines in my notes for NO REASON!"
1823,"After saving, when I go back into a note there will be sometimes 1 sometimes upto 5 lines inbetween each line my text as I scroll down."
1824,WHY!!!
1825,This used to be so good.
1826,The app is not allowing me to edit the note which was by created in the app it self.
1827,"The message that comes is ""Note was created using a external application ""."
1828,Yesterday I was able to edit the app.
1829,Please do the needful since the note is locked I am unable to do anything against it Emailing is also not helpful as they directly mentioned they do not respond to the email and have provided some sort of training links for Evernote.
1830,Please create a support team for better customer experience
1831,Widget functionality is taken away.
1832,"And when ""sharing"" a Web page into Evernote, it keeps old tags (which I don't always want), and actually goes INTO Evernote instead of just a quick overly pop up (which slows everything down)."
1833,The page clipping also seems to be taking a lot longer with this new version.
1834,"Evernote team, please bring back the old properly functioning options"
1835,Bring back the old Evernote please or bring back those missing features: widget + quick note access from notifications menu.
1836,"Speed is still an issue for those functions which have always been there: new note, search (especially within large notes of text) and camera access within a note."
1837,"This app is terrible, I can open new notes, write down my important info, and then never get access back into the note ever again."
1838,"Any ""saved"" note of mine that I want to open gets stuck on the loading screen, with wifi or without wifi."
1839,Ironic as ___ for an app called Evernote .
1840,"A significant backward step Now there is no way to select which maps to update, nor is there any indication of download size (why not?)."
1841,The option to download WITHOUT routing has disappeared.
1842,I do not require routing as I already have a sat nav.
1843,"Fortunately I have not updated my phone, only my tablet."
1844,I will not be updating my phone to v6 as this is the device I use most.
1845,Until now this was a 5 star app (and I had the paid version before it became free).
1846,Hugely disappointed.
1847,------------------UPDATE.
1848,Tried updating one small map (Guernsey 449kB) and found ALL my old maps had been deleted.
1849,The new style Guernsey map is 882kB.
1850,"I have backups of my old maps, so not a problem to recover them."
1851,"Doesn't upload and deletes posts It will upload small posts with no pictures in them, but as soon as I attempt to upload a longer post with photos it starts a never ending upload which never actually finishes."
1852,Then when you go back into the app to see what is going on it deletes the post you were trying to upload and you are left with only the title and the knowledge that you have entirely wasted your time and need to write the whole thing and locate all the media files again.
1853,Totally frustrating.
1854,It worked fine on iOS.
1855,I love Evernote over one note.
1856,Everything capability you can think of is  available in one note..... except nesting more than one level deep in  notebook creation.
1857,I'm a computer coder and my wife is a cook.
1858,It's nearly  impossible to keep my notes organized to the degree that I need too because  of this.
1859,"You can create your primary notebook and then then child notebooks  under that, but you can't create 'grandchildren', 'great grandchildren' etc  levels of notebook which is a MASSIVE drawback for me and my wife."
1860,"In my  mind, I would have thought it common sense that as a note taking app, this  would have been available."
1861,As a result I felt the need to give this  Evernote a 2 star review.
1862,"Unfortunately, I need to keep using one note in  order for me to be able to utilize my notes the way I need."
1863,"I though maybe  trying the premium version would allow us this option, but sadly, no."
1864,"As a  result I've been forced to cancel my premium account with Evernote and go  back to one note, which I hate, but does fulfill our needs."
1865,"If Evernote  does decide to utilize abilities to nest notebooks deeper than one level,  then I would gladly pay for the premium and change my rating to 5 stars."
1866,Some serious shortcomings makes this less than awesome.
1867,Some basic functionality is missing from the Android app.
1868,E.g there does not appear to be a way to delete unwanted notebooks.
1869,There are also some syncing issues: Making edits on the same note from different devices causes changes conflicts.
1870,A work around is to manually forcing syncs between changes.
1871,"The web interface jumps when pasting text, and will jump back to the top if you haven't done anything but read."
1872,No Linux client would be OK except the web client is frustrating.
1873,Evernote I want to Love You
1874,"New version has bugs Editing now is almost completely useless :( also have no idea why some bullets get removed sometimes when editing as well as when i scroll down in a note and point my finger to edit some text, it brings me back to the top, also goes from view to edit mode sometimes for no reason i can see."
1875,At least web version is still ok which is why still 2 stars instead of 1
1876,"Somewhat buggy & inconsistent :( I'm a HUGE fan of Evernote & am starting to use it across multiple platforms (Android, iOS, Windows)."
1877,"However, so far I've been having issues with inconsistency within the Android app."
1878,The screen where you edit existing notes frequently flashes back to the read-only screen of the note whenever I try to select some text or change text/formatting.
1879,"The changes I make are saved in the Edit view, but are not in the read-only view."
1880,Is this a known bug?
1881,"If so, please fix & I'll raise my rating significantly."
1882,Thx!
1883,"New Device Limit Feedback If you're going to lock us out of a 3rd device, which may be our Mobile App, at least give us access to Manage Devices in the mobile app!"
1884,There is no option.
1885,Read the new FAQ twice.
1886,I would be SCREWED if I could not access my notes on the go.
1887,Your FAQ also mentions you can't do so from a mobile browser.
1888,"Imagine this, I access my notes via Web from a Work PC with emergency contact info or boarding pass before I leave the country."
1889,But then I open up my Mobile App and can't access it?!
1890,Respond and I'll revise.
1891,Decent app The app works fairly well and is quite stable.
1892,"The sharing features are useful, but accessing them is not intuitive and I tire of digging through notebooks and chats to find information shared with me."
1893,"I find it largely inferior to Microsoft OneNote, and largely switched to using Google Keep for quick notes as it's faster and easier to access."
1894,Editing notes seems to take too many clicks in comparison to these other competitors.
1895,"Finally, the recent change limiting free users to two devices ended my use."
1896,Has some bugs with annotation.
1897,I have upgraded to premium to use the most out of Evernote and use it with it's full features.
1898,However annotating PDF works poorly especially since it creates on my disk or Adobe storage new pdf after every single edit!
1899,Over a while I made several comments and highlights on my pdf and ended up having several copies of the same document each containing one of the highlights/comments.
1900,Also aggregation of todos like in OneNote would be helpful a lot.
1901,Thanks!
1902,"Kindly add an option to add link directly through the app, not by the way of sharing from the browser."
1903,"Right now, I have to share from the browser to save the page."
1904,There seems to be no way to directly add url.
1905,Thank you.
1906,"---------------- Actually, I want to add new article/link to evernote by adding url in evernote."
1907,"i can't see how to take notes or save anything, or even how to find out what Evernote is supposed to do for me."
1908,"I can change my password, change my access level, and a few other administrative tasks, but what am I supposed to be able to do once I get all that sorted out?"
1909,"My intro period is about to end (6 days left) and I haven't used the app because i can't see how to, e g., create a note, enter some text, save a URL, etc."
1910,Why would I not uninstall?
1911,I have published a blog post one week ago on my computer and today I  decided to start writing a new post on the mobile app.
1912,I suddenly saw the  blog post that I have already published and shared it on all the social  media accounts in the draft section.
1913,I was confused so I clicked on it.
1914,"When I clicked on it the draft from one month ago opened, the post without  any pictures and half of the text missing."
1915,"I thought that it was super  weird so I checked it also on the computer and the original post that was  already published was gone, I could only found the draft."
1916,My heart stopped  and everything was lost.
1917,Thank god that the whole article was posted to my  email when it was published so I could just copy paste everything.
1918,The app  is not refreshing and updating the posts that are already published so I  will not use it anymore.
1919,"Ok for simple text but shear horror if you want to upload images.Upload is interrupted most of the time leaves the local media cache completely broken.No easy upload of multiple images (workaround via filemanager share dialog), no progress bar on upload (no idea if finished, incomplete or still working).Crashes if accidentally refresh media library during upload."
1920,"Please devs, add a decent way to upload images with progress info and feedback if it was successful or failed."
1921,Otherwise it's a real pain in the ass to use the  app.
1922,Last 2 updates made the formating menu useless while editing on a galaxy tab s2.
1923,Cannot use bullets.
1924,Working on a galaxy s5 mini though.
1925,Please fix.
1926,Have been taking all business notes with Premium for years and still able to find that decision that nobody quite remember about.
1927,Use pc and mac and android versions to have stuff always around.
1928,"Share cooking, POI and gift lists with friends and familly selectively."
1929,With more than 10000 notes still swift.
1930,Link POI to fantastic Locus offline map app to have them shown on a offline map on Android devices.
1931,Would love a dark theme too to spare battery when having the screen on while taking notes during lengthy meetings.
1932,Would also love better formatting possibilities that remain over cut and paste with Office applications
1933,"Incredibly bad After coming from the iOS version, it's clear where Evernote allocates its resources."
1934,This app is significantly inferior at almost every corner.
1935,The iOS version can record voice notes in-line and while the screen is off.
1936,The recordings created on Android do not play on iOS.
1937,"The interface — be it the landing screen, the editing screen, the voice recording animation, the formatting tools — it's all just a mess."
1938,"Nothing is fluid, and the movement from one tool to the next is awkward and nonsensical."
1939,Absolutely Love It!!!!
1940,This note app has everything!
1941,"From text to voice, email and sharing."
1942,It's your all in 1 note application.
1943,I also like the fact that you can download the app to any device and log in and change or edit your note in real time!
1944,Keep up the good work Evernote Team!!!!
1945,"UPDATE:  I still love Evernote, but I would like to take away three of those Stars!"
1946,It's funny how they have forced you to upgrade 2 higher packages than the standard free package.
1947,I have always liked this app until a couple of weeks ago.
1948,The app asked me if I wanted to upgrade to a Premium subscription or stay with the basic edition.
1949,"I tried to select ""stay with basic"", but the app wouldn't let me select that."
1950,"When I tried to open my notes, I could see them for 10 seconds before they were locked again."
1951,I signed up for a free one week Premium trial just so I did get info from my notes.
1952,"I cancelled, now they are trying to bill me."
1953,The e-mail support team is no help.
1954,"The app looks good and runs smooth, but the main note list lacks full adjustability."
1955,"You can turn on/off the text, date, tags, and images."
1956,"With this, the note list is still too spread out, always displaying a header with the letter of your title and the date."
1957,"It would be great if you can disable this, and be left with an alphabetical list of just your note titles."
1958,This would be more compact and efficient for phone use (in my humble opinion).
1959,Strange defects and incapacities I was able to post immediately with simple text updates immediately.
1960,Fine so far; one star.
1961,"I was able to edit a post immediately, and add a photo."
1962,"That's good, too; two stars."
1963,My edits DO NOT SHOW.
1964,Not so good.
1965,Minus one star.
1966,Video cannot be added from my phone; minus another star.
1967,The message that tells me that leads to a non-mobile-optimized website for a videohosting/upload site; minus another star.
1968,"I would have paid for an app that would allow this, but not an ongoing fee of US$60, thanks."
1969,Not going to ding you for trying to make a living; I don't blame you in the slightest.
1970,Just try not to make your sales pitch so obnoxious.
1971,EDITED- SOMETHING IS WRONG.
1972,"POSTS ARE NOT POSTING, PICTURES ARE NOT UPLOADING, PEOPLE ARE NOT ABLE TO VIEW POSTS."
1973,PLEASE FIX.
1974,Wonderful.
1975,I like the upgraded version of this app.
1976,I've used WordPress for years but your new step forward is amazing.
1977,Just a little request though.
1978,PLEASE ADD 'SHARE' OPTION IN SITE PAGES SO THAT WE COULD SHARE LINKS OF OUR INDIVIDUAL SITE PAGES FROM THE APP FOR THOSE OF US MANAGING MULTIPLE PAGES IN ONE WEBSITE.
1979,THANKS.
1980,Good app but.....
1981,"It is a brilliant app, but i have not rated this 5 stars, because I can't multi-task on it (have two notes up at the same time)."
1982,Another good addition would be the ability to place skitch pictures next to text (not just isolated at the top)  or instead of this have sketch integrated into evernote so i can use both at the same time.
1983,"My last point is about the email option, When I send a piece of work to my email address, the note appears in the email and not as a document attachment."
1984,This is frustrating because I have to then put it into word document.
1985,Thanks for this brilliant app and it was definitely worth getting.
1986,If these problems get addressed i will re-rate it 5 stars.
1987,"Cant correct my email When I installed and signed up, my phone's autocorrect input my email wrong and I didn't notice."
1988,Now I can't change it.
1989,"I go into settings/account info/edit profile, and there I can change ""full name"" but nothing else."
1990,"Occassionally the app will give a pop up to ""update email address""."
1991,"I click to do so,  but the email address field is read-only no matter what I do."
1992,"One time it let me change it, and I DID!"
1993,But the change never took effect.
1994,"I sent request for support, but your web help form uses my acct email"
1995,"Needs web clipping function This is handy for reading notes created on the desktop version or creating new text notes, pictures, etc., but if you are using any browser besides Dolphin the web clipping function clips the HTML address for a page and not the actual page."
1996,Doesn't even have the simplified article option.
1997,I would rather not switch to Dolphin because using Chrome for android as well as for desktop gives me a more seamless experience.
1998,Not sure whether the problem lies with Evernote or with Chrome.
1999,"EDIT 2 phone corrupts old notes when editing & I Can't sync or delete them EDIT: on new desktop app, caps lock disables control commands (ctrl+b bold etc) I have used & loved free & paid evernote versions."
2000,"This is my key digital reference folder for meeting, lecture notes, creative ideas etc."
2001,using GTD Getting Things Done.
2002,90% amazing.
2003,auto correct is doing my head in (Samsung S9) but desktop application is seamless (bar some awkward/limited formatting).
2004,Moleskin integration works pretty well.
2005,Perpetualy short of being a great tool The concept and most of its implementation is great.
2006,But the devil is in the detail.
2007,Have u tried to use the Evernote on your phone or tablet?
2008,It is frustratingly hard.
2009,There is no copy / paste feature on the phone.
2010,Huh?
2011,Seriously Evernote?!
2012,"When editing a note you can't add a check list item, and there are number of items like this that are frustrating."
2013,You can't password protect a note.
2014,"Duh, Evernote."
2015,"I've been using evernote for a while, btw."
2016,Share option has become prescriptive I loved Evernote.
2017,The upgrade has a particularly infuriating feature.
2018,"I used to be able email links to my Notes using the Share option to open my work or personal email apps, then email the Share URL.The share option now channels through Evernote messages."
2019,Forcing friends and colleagues I want to share  links to Notes with to download Evernote.
2020,Now can't share Notes easily.
2021,It's not my job to sell Evernote for you guys.
2022,Not clever.
2023,Android version needs work No undo.
2024,No undelete.
2025,The back button should save the note like other notes apps.
2026,Save is hard to get to.
2027,Cant just tap when viewing to edit note.
2028,Edit mode needs to support phone numbers and links like Gnotes.
2029,I uninstalled this app and use gnotes hooked up to gmail which is the least annoying to me (syncing fails frequently but I reconnect).
2030,Android notes apps are pretty bad.
2031,"too many updates and some minor annoyances good solid app,  but too many updates all the time."
2032,"Plus,  some of the UI needs works."
2033,"They need to improve search mechanism,  so you can jump to your result rather than scroll,  scroll,  scroll."
2034,"scroll....   Edit was cumbersome if you needed just to change text in certain locations like top,  middle,  or bottom of notes."
2035,App is much better since I last used it.
2036,"Though, locating a specific post is tricky and time consuming (unless it's a recent post)."
2037,The list will not show old posts unless you reload and continuously scroll to the bottom.
2038,Then repeat said process.
2039,I have hundreds of posts and finding one from a few years back is simply not worth doing with the app (even though I know the date and title).
2040,A search filter would be nice.
2041,Updated 9/12/18.
2042,I got a ransom ware threat from Evernote today.
2043,We are canceling your notes (deleting I assume) unless you pay for premium or delete all devices except one.
2044,It asked me if I wanted to delete my iPhone.
2045,I've never owned a iPhone so now I believe my notes have been compromised.
2046,I will copy all notes asap and uninstall Evernote.
2047,Although it was a decent app.
2048,How much code does it really take to write a note taking app?
2049,Previous review: This is for the developer contact.
2050,I.e.
2051,there is no contact.
2052,I wanted to leave a comment about a problem I keep having editing notes (when entering a new line in a note the following line loses it's word spacing bunching all the words together) however there appears to be no way to contact anyone at Evernote.
2053,"Every option for contact leads you to ""Make a ticket"" with no option to make this ticket (whatever that is)."
2054,Maybe the app is so good they don't want feedback?
2055,Sorry for leaving the comment here but you left me no other option.
2056,BTW the app works great other than that one small problem - oh and the lack of support.
2057,I would give it 5 stars otherwise.
2058,"Uninstalled - Provide ""Evernote Private"" version I can no longer share contacts and calendars with Evernote, so must uninstall."
2059,Have you asked your employer recently if they are good with the permissions?
2060,"Please provide a restricted version with fewer permissions ""Evernote Private"", without the privacy issues and albeit, less functionality."
2061,"You have to admit, the permissions below sound Big-Brother-ish."
2062,"Even if we trust Evernote's intentions, Evernote's servers have been hacked is the past."
2063,"""YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION READ CALENDAR EVENTS PLUS CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION Allows the app to read all calendar events stored on your tablet, including those of friends or co-workers."
2064,"This may allow the app to share or save your calendar data, regardless of confidentiality or sensitivity."""
2065,Yesterday I lost an important note which I prepared an effort of past 3 years and am deeply Disappointed in this.
2066,we trusted Evernote and saving such kind of important notes.
2067,"if you people are behaving irresponsible like this, its really BBBAAADDDD!!!"
2068,Story goes like this: Almost all the working days I used to add important information in Evernote.
2069,same thing happened yesterday also and it was around 2PM.
2070,"I got a pop up message @ 5pm, showing that Evernote cannot sync the latest update."
2071,I pressed ok button and suddenly all the information in that particular note were disappeared.
2072,suddenly I sent the error report also.
2073,Now I would like to recover my note.
2074,can anybody help in this matter?
2075,It's been ages since I created and last used the account.
2076,"Loaded app to my new phone, tried to log in-didn't work."
2077,"Reset password, tried again-didn't work."
2078,"Logged into my profile online, but can't log into web application because.... there's no account associated with my email!?!?"
2079,"(If so, how did I log into my profile, and why does it show my email???)"
2080,"Reset password again, tried logging in AGAIN, still didn't work."
2081,"And the kicker is, since I'm on basic plan, I can't even create support ticket!"
2082,"This app used to be useful, now my info is compromised unless I pay to upgrade!"
2083,I used Evernote for years without issue.
2084,"Last week I logged in and was forced to use one of 3 times to sign out a suspicious iPhone (I have never used an iPhone) so I added security to my account, including password."
2085,Today I tried logging in and I have another mysterious device log in.
2086,I am removing all my information and ditching this app - either there is a security leak somewhere or the developers are involved.
2087,The map itself is good.
2088,thus it can not choose the route between highway and a free road.
2089,the main problem is.
2090,before i was sighn in into a google from this app.
2091,to keep organised my bookmarks.
2092,now my phone was little broke.
2093,i reinstall android 6.0 OS to my phone.
2094,then i reinstall maps.me and then.
2095,i was trying to sighn in into a google service from the app.
2096,to retrieve my bookmarks.
2097,but i get a message from google.
2098,that they not support this app anymore.
2099,because only browsers permitted to make authorisation requests to google.
2100,it's classifieds as embedded user agent also known as a web-view.
2101,anyway i can't get my bookmarks back.
2102,not allowed anymore.
2103,and google authorisation still there.
2104,kind of useless now for me.
2105,Maps are stored on internal memory by default.
2106,Even when app itself is moved to SD.
2107,There is no option in settings to change the location of maps to SD card.
2108,App has to be open all the time during maps download.
2109,If you move to other app download stops and has to be started from the very beginning.
2110,Maps are not downloaded in background.
2111,"Leaving screen with download progress shown resets download from say 50 % to 0%, meaning you cannot use your phone during maps downloading process untill it completely finished."
2112,I'm quite disappointed with the evernote android app.
2113,"I shared a screenshot with evernote: the note just contains a cryptic attachment that doesn't work, no thumbnail even."
2114,"Another example: the link to a website from which you copy a selection of text does not get put in the note, making keeping notes for websites I visit from my phone comp impractical."
2115,"Capturing complete webpage is ridiculous, it's way more info than I need, I want only the important piece that will jog my memory when I see it."
2116,October 2019 update.
2117,"I used to love this app and have been using it since 2013, and a paid member since 2016."
2118,A few weeks ago it stopped allowing me to access PDF files on Android.
2119,"I have dozens, maybe hundreds of notes that I need."
2120,I contacted Evernote and the problem has still not been fixed.
2121,2013.
2122,Easy to use.
2123,"Attach pictures, make check lists, just the best app."
2124,It's good but.....
2125,It's good but some more improvements required such as edit post quickly......
2126,"I am using wp but when I trying to edit previous post,option shows but not edit another problem is setting, view site,user options not working  and site stats shows too late please upgrade it's suddenly."
2127,"Great, but could be a lot better."
2128,"Having used the app for a little while now, I'd like to see more work put into it."
2129,"For instance, I'd like to have the option of disabling the local storage of notes on my phone."
2130,"I'd also like to see the incorporation of a simple To-do list add-on that works similarly to Wunderlist, with reminders and quick simple text entries."
2131,Being able to edit shared lists (check tasks) and notes would be great too.
2132,"I understand that there are more security features and the ability to edit shared notes with the premium account, but this is not worth anything near $45 per annum."
2133,"Potentially a true 5 star app, but as it stands, I might uninstall it."
2134,"No Android Love I like evernote wanted to love it,but compared to windows and mac version it doesn't compare, give android users some love, let us change the view setting, give us the same tool options, and it would be nice if there was a spell check and color coding options on the tags or notebooks, why are you guys so afraid of  color!"
2135,Still looks plain to me but still a good note app.
2136,It it was appealing to the eye and more options for android users would get better ratings.
2137,"needs a sync option, and more features on the widget."
2138,why do i need to sync note every time i open the app and edit notes?
2139,it uses data and slow the app in place with slow internet.
2140,"needs an option to sync every week, more like offline app."
2141,why cant i edit notes directly from the widget?
2142,whats the point of having a huge evernote in my home if i cant edit there?
2143,thanks
2144,Works well enough But I do have two issues.
2145,"1) When I save a note, Evernote automatically appends a space."
2146,It's annoying to have to type backspace before starting to type.
2147,2) It appears the app syncs when you open a note.
2148,Edits from other devices may not show immediately.
2149,This may be an issue with the accompanying widget though.
2150,improvements needed i cannot make folder in Evernote or send an existing note into a notebook.
2151,the using of the methods are too complex.
2152,more organized view ne  in web i cannot put easily the data into particular locations.
2153,make it simple to share the folder or the contents of it.
2154,display theme is not quite well
2155,"When I try to add the Evernote List widget it gives me the following error ""Problem loading widget""."
2156,"It only happens with this specific one, if I try to add the Evernote Action Bar works fine."
2157,The app is up to date.
2158,Could have been better Purchase the Pro version because sometimes internet/Google Maps is not always accessible.
2159,"The maps looks good at first glance, especially it has street number in the map."
2160,The most unbearable problem so far is the poor searching function: tried to find a certain address but the map can not actively find the exact location and re-center the map to the target location.
2161,"Moreover, it seems that the app does not recognize the address at all and do nothing."
2162,If you can not even search an address then this maps in a sense is crippled.
2163,"My cell phone is LG G3, Android 4.4.2, had already loaded with the maps used for address searching."
2164,The app is pretty handcuffed when compared with the web editor.
2165,"The app lacks easy linking to already published posts, a way to copy a previous post, and the mouse support on Android is terrible - formatting buttons and most dialog boxes don't respond to mouse clicks at all."
2166,"Basic interaction with the admin side, such as comment moderation and stats are fine, but for actually creating and publishing content, the app is very much a second class citizen compared to the web editor."
2167,Full integration of the web editor capabilities would make for a much better experience.
2168,Technically Very Bad!
2169,"I love osm, but this app far from good."
2170,"Slow rendering of maps, poor info and bad navigation of pois, but most importantly it drains ur device battery!!!"
2171,Even if in the background  have it uses 40-50% CPU heated up to 77 degC:  130|root@jfltexx:/ # top | grep map                                             25348  1  48% S    34 956836K  66984K  bg u0_a276  com.mapswithme.maps.pro 25348  1  45% S    34 956836K  66984K  bg u0_a276  com.mapswithme.maps.pro 25348  1  43% S    34 956836K  66984K  bg u0_a276  com.mapswithme.maps.pro 25348  1  41% S    34 956836K  66984K  bg u0_a276  com.mapswithme.maps.pro 25348  1  44% S    34 956836K  66984K  bg u0_a276  com.mapswithme.maps.pro 25348  1  48% S      I didnt say its the location as i didnt debug it just saw it uses CPU a lot as you can see.
2172,"I did nothing but do a search and view points on the map, then press home button."
2173,I'm sure you can reproduce it.
2174,"This latest version changed my default map location from SD card to main memory, then told me I didn't have enough memory to update my maps, although this version only updates changes."
2175,"I then had to download my maps again after changing the location, as it STILL doesn't recognise that I already have downloaded maps!"
2176,Just to add that I have used maps from my sdcard correctly for a few years now!
2177,This rating only applies to the latest version which screwed up my configuration.
2178,"This forced me to re download maps that are already on my sdcard, as even after changing the location back to the sdcard, the app still didn't check for the existent of valid maps in the selected location."
2179,Can't access my own site!
2180,"Previous version (on my Android phone) wouldn't let me access my Notifications, so I just updated the app, hoping this would help."
2181,"Now it won't even let me in to my own site unless I click on View External - but then I no longer have access to any options like Stats, edit, etc."
2182,"Not user friendly, and very frustrating."
2183,Please fix these problems!
2184,"UPDATE: After a ""response"" and multiple uninstalls, reinstalls & updates, same problem is still there."
2185,Can't access my own blog using this app!
2186,Useless.
2187,For the last God knows how many months I have had no end of problems with this app.
2188,"From not being able to upload photos, to my site being hidden when it's quite blatantly not, and not being able to start a new post, oy being able go into setting for about 5 seconds be for it puts me back to the main menu."
2189,"Support advised reinstalling Jetpack, but that's not changed a thing."
2190,I'm giving it one last try.
2191,I'm not the only one having issues either.
2192,There's a few ppl I know who are having problems.
2193,No updates fix this.
2194,Thought this was a simple way to easily create a blog but it wouldn't let me have the same username/blog/url name so I attempted to delete but apparently that isn't an option.
2195,"Followed all the steps to change my email, that won't work either."
2196,I've tried several times and the link I'm being sent via email just keeps bringing up a page telling me I need to confirm my email again.
2197,"I clicked contact us to get help, but it just posts it to a community forum????"
2198,I just want the whole blog/username GONE
2199,Used to be a nice app but it seems it is getting worse as time passes.
2200,The  latest is that is impossible to sync/transfer your bookmarks.
2201,"The help is  outdated giving you wrong indications, making you loose a lot of time."
2202,They  say that your bookmarks are in a folder on SD card.
2203,No folder and no  bookmarks there.
2204,"They say you should sign in to backup your bookmarks in a  safe place, but you can tap all day long on the sign in button, nothing  happens..."
2205,"But they also say that if you by miracle manage to sign in,  those bookmarks will not be available on other devices."
2206,May be they all  have the same phone from 6-7 years ago and never had to transfer their  bookmarks...
2207,They say you can share bookmarks with your friends.
2208,"I've  shared one of my many lists via Wi-Fi direct between my devices, but it's  archived and there is no option to import."
2209,Now you have to download another  app to extract that archive but still no way to import them...
2210,Awful waste  of time...
2211,Great... until it fails!
2212,Overall it did the job as a convenient note taking app.
2213,"Today while in class I went to the desktop, a practice I had done regularly as it usually saves automatically, to check something."
2214,"When I switched back to EN, it says my note was not saved and was gone!"
2215,"I opened a file explorer to see if I could recover it, but to no avail."
2216,"I did some Google searching to find a way to bring it back, but no luck."
2217,"This is unacceptable and until they ensure data is saved regularly, either locally or in the cloud, I will be switching to another application!"
2218,Ever Note Could be such a better app.
2219,"Open it up already lost, no info about anything really."
2220,You really don't have options.
2221,"Colors of paper well just white, great for organizing what from what.."
2222,"Settings nothing, theres no top buttons to get you  started... Don't bother!!"
2223,I finally just deleted it forever.
2224,I found a much better one.
2225,Thanks
2226,Update UI issues The UI faces some tremendous update glitches when I try to set big Dailies or To-Dos with lots of checklist items and lots of reminders.
2227,Either they disappear after saving and reappear randomly afterwards or they don't appear at all unless I remove the app from memory completely and reload it.
2228,Also the reminders feature though nice to have - they need major refinement.
2229,Better have a frequency option for reminders as well.
2230,I only downloaded this app coz I moved from Samsung to Huawei phone and unfortunately I can't move snotes to Huawei.
2231,"So this app was in my Samsung by default and I read it's review and it seemed good, therefore I downloaded it in my Huawei so I can move notes and edit what I need in the notes , I didn't even hesitate to subscribe in premium."
2232,But then I found out that the notes I move is only for read-only and there is no option to change that in Evernote.. so disappointing..
2233,I wanted to send an email to the Evernote team sadly I didn't find an option for that either.
2234,So here I am ..
2235,I hope you update this point; 1) coz I read many reviews in Google that users are asking for it.
2236,And 2) coz there is no point in installing Evernote in my new phone if I can't edit my notes I rather just rewrite it again than pay money for an app am not fully satisfied with.
2237,"FYI, I unsubscribed from premium just now which is not even 24 hours from the moment I subscribed."
2238,Evernote has started freezing as soon as I open any note.
2239,"I downgraded to a much older version and saw an error message where it hangs: ""Note edit error: Android system is updating."
2240,"Please try again in a few seconds.""."
2241,"However, the system is not updating."
2242,If seems Evernote devs in their infinite wisdom applied the ostrich method of debugging and removed that message.
2243,That is why the new version gets frozen without any explanation.
2244,Why is this happening?
2245,Decent app.
2246,Tried out a few offline nav apps that use osm for data and this had the best looking map display for me.
2247,Clean and clear display during navigation a plus.
2248,"Suggested nav routes were generally good, but did not care for the inability to ignore toll roads as well as to get more than one suggested route."
2249,"The biggest shortcoming for me was that with just about all osm apps, the POI/address search are useless unless those items are entered in the osm database."
2250,A suggestion would be to have a online search function (like MapFactor's google search) to be able to find those items and be able to translate the info into an offline nav point.
2251,"Another suggestion would be to improve the display functions during navigation, ie: speedometer/speeding warnings, lane assist, and fixed speed cameras."
2252,Needs improvements but a solid app overall.
2253,Issues Downloading Maps to External Storage I installed the app and for several days have tried to download maps with routing for several US states.
2254,I used settings to download the maps to my external SD card.
2255,The app shows and says that maps or downloading/downloaded at first.
2256,If I exit the app and reenter.
2257,only a couple of maps now show as downloaded.
2258,Tried to uninstall/install several times and still does not work correctly.
2259,More stars when this major feature is working correctly.
2260,Update: Giving you three stars due to quick response and concern!
2261,See my email to you with the requested info.
2262,Let's get this working together!
2263,3 stars and still paying monthly.. i have high hopes 😨 Keep doing: 1.
2264,Love  how im not locked into the google or apple env.
2265,2.
2266,Love notebooks.
2267,3.
2268,Love  UX and UI fundamentals.
2269,4.
2270,Love the API and how easy it is to write(modify  in my case) a client for evernote.
2271,5.
2272,Love how sync is handled (hate Google  keep in this regard).
2273,Do better: 1.
2274,Why is there no active notebook.
2275,Something to land on thats not an aggregation of all my notes.
2276,I have a  workbook for notes taken during each work Sprint ... half the time i dont  care to see all my notes .. this is bad UX and only good for prople that  aren't using Evernote correctly.
2277,2.
2278,There shoule be variantions of the Text  Note template (ex: A deticated checklist.. handled in the same fashion as  Google Keep (checked items grey out and are pushed to a separate zone at  the bottom of the note)) Cheers!
2279,"UI doesnt make sense sometimes, but otherwise excellent for cross platform note taking	-1 star for making notebook/tag navigation more complicated than it should be."
2280,Why on earth is the main activity the parent of the note list when I navigated to it via the notebook/tag list ?
2281,-1 star for making pin lock premium only.
2282,It's the only one premium feature I'm interested in but I'm not going to shell out $5/mth for it ...
2283,Otherwise this is an excellent app for cross platform note taking.
2284,"Toolbar Change -1 What happened to the ""save"" option on the tool bar after the latest update?!?!"
2285,Was very handy to have right there to touch while taking notes.
2286,Now it's hidden in the dropdown menu.
2287,Need the button back or the app needs to autosave automatically a la Gmail.
2288,It's good but.....
2289,It's good but some more improvements required such as edit post quickly......
2290,"I am using wp but when I trying to edit previous post,option shows but not edit another problem is setting, view site,user options not working  and site stats shows too late please upgrade it's suddenly."
2291,"It's kind of a good idea, however, reordering tasks and dailies and such is so much hassle."
2292,I tried to drag and drop them how I wanted.
2293,They won't go where you drag them and are reappearing in some random order each time I refresh.
2294,I also have to edit/create tags multiple times before they are properly saved.
2295,It's a bit time consuming trying to make your lists when your changes are lost so frequently.
2296,"Doesn't search by postcode, the three locations I tried came up with no  results (the locations have been there for over 20 years), then when you  search for the actual road names and find them, the area it lists them in  is usually wrong, so you'd have to really know where you were heading  before you trusted it."
2297,"The app also seems to only give you one route  choice, no option to change to quickest or shortest in the settings, or  avoid motorways etc."
2298,Can't really comment on much else as I gave up after  learning those things.
2299,"All in all it's basic, the navigation is competent  but very sensitive to kinks in a road (so be prepared to bear left / right  a lot when you're just following a road)."
2300,"My advice is to use Navmii which  isn't perfect, but light years ahead of this."
2301,Slow and broken for long distance travel.
2302,App slows randomly and takes forever to find a path.
2303,"When you search for a location and see the name of the place you want to go to, you can't select until it loads all other relevant locations related to the query which wastes around 10 seconds."
2304,I'm using a PCT L29 Huawei phone for reference with the whole map downloaded with over 40gb of free space and no other application running.
2305,This is a terrible app.
2306,Use Google maps instead.
2307,Nearly no function worked properly.
2308,The app updated older versions of post drafts so that the recent progress was deleted.
2309,The draft mode does not show contents like lists or images.
2310,Uninstalled.
2311,"The mobile bowser version works fine, while the app is causing more problems than is solves."
2312,"Downloaded this app hoping for a fun way to form new habits, but when I get to the register screen the first two tutorial panels are blank and then the third one lets you link social media accounts."
2313,"Then I can't save the username and display name I create, and the avatar generator screen doesn't load any options."
2314,Opened the app the next day to find nothing I could edit had been saved.
2315,Uninstalled and tried registering again with a different account and got the same results.
2316,Pretty disappointed
2317,???
2318,I don't know how anyone figured out how to use this useless to me app.
2319,"I went to the Evernote website, slogged through their ""explanation"" on getting started, looked at all their illustrative pictures and found NOTHING that looked like anything on my Samsung S tablet."
2320,"Nothing matched, including the so-called explanations."
2321,"Also, the links didn't work."
2322,How did anyone figure out how to use this?
2323,"I have no experience with evernote to build on, and there doesn't seem to be anywhere on the web that shows the screens that are appearing on the Samsung tablet."
2324,What gives?
2325,"(Besides me, giving up after hours of trying to find something anything that might give clues."
2326,"So far, it looks like bloatware."
2327,Can't delete it AND can't join it.)
2328,I wish I could give negative star because it steals time and creates frustration.
2329,Do not install if you have choice and still have sanity.
2330,"Very unstable on Asus Tablet Adding photos via the camera very often crashes the app, which then of course loses everything you've written."
2331,If you want to use it I suggest saving every sentence unless you really enjoy retyping.
2332,"Annoyingly this also closes the post, so you have to constantly go back into edit mode."
2333,Thank goodness I have the keyboard dock.
2334,"Also, adding photos does work, and it lets you set alignment, but it doesn't seem to be able to properly type text to flow around those images, so using Alignment None is really the only option."
2335,"As a cyclist I have to say that this is the only app so far that I have checked that allows you to create routes using small roads that doesn't crash or fails for some random reason or has them all removed; google maps, strava, osmand, bike citizen, here we go, sygic maps, all of them failed spectacularly, this one did not."
2336,"However the real problem is that I am unable to create anything but short routes due to the limitations in the amount of stops that I can add; given there are tons of forest roads you can never pick the one you like and make something longer than 30km of a route; It also isn't even a paid feature, I'd have paid for such feature in a heartbeat."
2337,"Two fixes, having 3 stops is ok if I can chain routes, as in save them and load them quickly; or allowing to add up to 10+ stops, the average that you need on 80+km rides on these forest mazes."
2338,"Back to square one having to buy a GPS, and these garmins aren't cheap at all; I am however pleased on how close this was to actually work, that I dared to write this review; hoping they implement it, even if it's paid; maybe they can have competition in something they never expected to."
2339,"Adds have been added in one of the never versions, don't update if you haven't already!"
2340,"It's a good app, but it's NOT a universal map."
2341,"It works best if you find your destination address with a browser, as the names in OSM don't always match."
2342,"Due to size limits, searching by street numbers is not possible and this severely limits your options."
2343,"The app goes nuts if your GPS is broken, and you can't just follow the route by moving the map with fingers, as popups keep reappearing."
2344,"Maps.me is best if you just move to points you know in advance, using the best in class bookmark system"
2345,Settings don't save Incredibly annoying that my KM to Miles & hide zoom settings get reset as soon as I make a search.
2346,"Also wish the searching was programmed to find words in a sentence and not exact phrases; couldnt find a result for ""tokyo tower"", once I manually found the location it had Tokyo Tower in parenthesis."
2347,Knows a lot of places though.
2348,Also REALLY wish the search button wasn't like 3 clicks away should be default on the maps screen
2349,Not as good as Springpad Long time Springpad user.
2350,"Sadly had to find an alternative due to the June 25, 2014 shutdown of Springpad."
2351,Decided to try Evernote using the Springpad export feature (Evernote waived the file size limit for this changeover).
2352,Export went well.
2353,The interface is functional but bland.
2354,I could find items faster in Springpad without having to do a search.
2355,Springpad notes could also be accessed offline without having to pay a premium (Evernote charges $45/yr).
2356,Since I primarily access notes offline this is a huge step-down for me since I can't yet see that Evernote is worth the extra expense and NONE of the other premium features are needed by me.
2357,I may change my opinion with time but I will still look for an alternative.
2358,Thankfully I also exported my Springpad notes separately from Evernote.
2359,I barely recognize this app from the beginning I have been with Evernote for years!
2360,"Used it across devices - computers, laptops, tablets, phones and told EVERYONE about it!"
2361,"Now, I barely open it."
2362,"The many, many updates have left me in the dust."
2363,I started opening it and not knowing WTH was going on inside the app.
2364,As it continued to update it became less and less useful to me as it became less and less simple to use.
2365,"With some of the apps, it really would be nice if you could choose to go back to, or not use an upgraded version if it works for you as is."
2366,"Bug report on checkboxes Very useful and helpful app, HOWEVER!"
2367,"Annoying issue with check boxes, when I insert a checkbox and start typing a word as soon as I hit SPACE or if any autocompleting occurs it removes the checkbox and I have to add it back each time this also happens when a suggested word is selected from keyboard."
2368,Very annoying and workflow interruptive.
2369,Only started happening in the  last few months.
2370,Currently up to date as well so no fix has been implemented yet.
2371,FIX THIS AND I'LL GIVE 5 STARS
2372,I downloaded and actively used the application back in 2015.
2373,It presented an exciting and innovative vision to note taking and sharing which seemed oddly refreshing.
2374,"Over the years It has morphed into a stressful and nagging ""pay for premium"" for no clear added benefit."
2375,"But worst of all the security level is frighteningly low as it is the only app where my access info has been repeatedly compromised, dangerously exposing my personal details."
2376,Now clearing my notes and finally closing my account.
2377,Bad UI layout Don't upgrade: the new version uses too much screen space!
2378,"I can only fit 4 note titles on screen, with all the unnecessary stuff."
2379,"Give me a way to turn off the letter headings, dates, & note counts!"
2380,Wish I could go back...
2381,"Otherwise, a great app."
2382,I use this for regular work and other projects.
2383,"Recent update auto assigns a category, making it roughly a 3 step process to change each time something falls in a different category."
2384,This change has made every time i open the app an exercise in frustration to set the right project category.
2385,Notes and pictures are very hard to share with non evernote users.
2386,"I am a paying user for the image search capabilities, but may discontinue that now that this is so hard to use."
2387,I want the function it had when I signed up and paid.
2388,"I've used Evernote for years and still believe it is great, but I am becoming increasingly frustrated with the android app."
2389,"Mainly this is due to crazy formatting when clipping a webpage from chrome (menu -> share -> add to Evernote), or even just copy and paste, as 'paste plain text' pastes with exactly the same formatting as the standard paste option."
2390,"If I want to ensure I've got a useable note, I have to check/edit/reimport it on the desktop app, which defeats the point of a mobile interface"
2391,Hi!
2392,I am using the app three year and I like it so much.
2393,It's the best I think.
2394,But since the last update the format bar didn't work 😞 and I need it to make notes more dinamic.
2395,Also the eparate bar don't appear and for me it's useful.
2396,"The bar appear in the screen but the functions (bold, highlight, list...) didn't work."
2397,"Because that I'm looking for new apps, with different formats and options to organize the info."
2398,Thanks.
2399,I loved the app until now...with this new update someone messed up on the scan a new document settings.
2400,When you scan a document it doesn't let me share it or download it.
2401,"Seems like someone has it saving each image as a .png in the file name when the actual document is .jpg,.jpeg so it corrupts the file making it not shareable."
2402,I'd like to see a fix happen.
2403,For this reason I now have to use another app.
2404,"I want to love this app, but can't."
2405,"Searching has too many problems: locations don't return results, and switching between map/list view makes some entries disappear."
2406,"I love the spirit of this app, but without reliable search, I cant use it."
2407,UPDATE: I worked with support for 3 separate bugs.
2408,"They were pleasant and prompt, but 2 of the issues remain, and they are deal-breakers for me."
2409,I genuinely look forward to using this app in a year or two when its more reliable.
2410,I have a premium subscription.
2411,"I use this as my primary note taking app, it  syncs very well between all my devices."
2412,"HOWEVER on mobile, whenever a note  starts to get larger there is a significant delay in text input, it  freezes, the keyboard seizes up etc."
2413,"I am using a note 8, so the phone is  more than capable of having a large amount of editable text."
2414,"In addition to  this, other apps do not have this issue."
2415,Therefore it is a flaw in  evernote's code.
2416,"It would be a 5 star review, however this issue makes  evernote unusable to me and having to migrate to another app at this point  would be very inconvineant: I would not have used evernote in the first  place if this flaw was disclosed to me."
2417,Having to keep making dozens of  segmented notes is not an option for me in my workflow.
2418,"I hope this can be  fixed soon, otherwise I will need to move elsewhere."
2419,"WORTHLESS IF IT WON""T SAVE YOUR WORK!"
2420,I was making study notes with my desktop version of Evernote and I spent a good couple of hours doing it.
2421,Come to find out that it didn't save my work even though I synced multiple times.
2422,"When I went to retrieve it on other devices, it wasn't there so I synced and still nothing."
2423,I went back to my desktop to see if it was there and it was.
2424,So I synced again and it disappeared!
2425,"Of course there is an option for ""note history"" for premium members."
2426,I feel like they just try to suck you in and then force you to buy their premium account.
2427,I couldn't even tell them directly how upset I was because they only offer support to premium members.
2428,"I guess if you want to shell out $45 bucks to become a premium member then it would be worth it, but until then no thanks, I'll use something else that is more reliable."
2429,Used Evernote years back but gave it up due to poor organizational system  in the app.
2430,I decided to give it another go after getting a Pixelbook.
2431,I've  been trying to use this to take notes for school for a few days and it  saved the first day of notes (maybe half a sheet worth).
2432,Everything after  that will not save.
2433,Have even re-written them to have them disappear.
2434,"I'm  connected to the internet, I check out of it, tried all the troubleshooting  and recovery things and they are just gone."
2435,I'm sure it has something to do  with them wanting me to pay for a premium version but if I cannot get more  than a half a page of notes before I start having problems then I am not  going to consider a subscription.
2436,I don't get it...
2437,I'm looking for a way to sort my notes that has more depth than Google Keep or other simple to-do list type apps.
2438,"I'd heard Evernote was exactly what I want, but man is it not."
2439,This layout is so unintuitive to me.
2440,And honestly it's surprisingly ugly.
2441,Icons look outdated.
2442,"Android design elements are present, but misused and mangled making it feel clunky."
2443,"For something that's supposed to help me organize, it sure isn't organized well."
2444,"If I'm gonna live inside a notebook app, it needs to work like I do."
2445,Had installed we Evernote several years earlier and uninstalled it.
2446,Today decided to reinstall it and then remembered why I had uninstalled in the first place.
2447,"Evernote seems like a very sneaky app, in my opinion."
2448,Examples: 1.
2449,They say you can save all kinds of notes.
2450,And they lock down accessing those notes if you're offline (unless you upgrade).
2451,2.
2452,There is no live chat (unless you upgrade).
2453,"(Running out of space here, so can't elaborate) Uninstalled again."
2454,Garbage Who needs a password protected notepad.
2455,Thank you for blocking me out of my own notes.
2456,And showing everyone that you somehow created an app that let's people access your stuff.
2457,Please make passwords an option and not a must.
2458,Now I lost all my stuff unless I create an account just to copy it and past it to a better app that doesn't require a password to check my grocery list.
2459,I wish there was a way to send logs and get support directly from within the app.
2460,"The ""Send Logs"" option under settings opens up an email with logs but there is no recipient."
2461,This app crashes constantly whenever in tablet mode on my Pixelbook but will only run in laptop mode.
2462,It's extremely unreliable when trying to use it to get work done.
2463,Editor is missing not even half the functionality as the one in the web browser.
2464,You can't even add a heading or set the font size.
2465,The only way to do it is by going to the HTML editor and add a tag that way.
2466,"The only good thing about this is being able to manage posts, pages and comments (move or remove them)."
2467,"If you want to edit posts or page on your phone or tablet, you're better to do it another one and copy + paste it in using the web browser admin panel."
2468,Bad for thorough notes.
2469,Unreliable Evernote has a lot of potential but the android platform is riddled with errors.
2470,I was trying to ride through the problems as most of them were small as I loved the search functionality for going through tons of academic notes.
2471,"The problems are mostly small but constant, like how evernote will randomly remove some spaces when I try to edit the note in android."
2472,"Unfortunately, just now I was taking thorough notes for an hour, clicked save, and evernote had an error and lost all progress."
2473,My laptop and mobile phone were stolen and if I want access to the dozens of files I created and saved I have to upgrade because I've replaced my stolen devices.
2474,I won't do that.
2475,Access to those files include a lot of information regarding a pending lawsuit.
2476,I absolutely loved the app until this moment.
2477,The experience of using the app is amazing.
2478,"I can access my admin version of the site and start publishing or scheduling, or even adding a draft to set up with getting back with my computer."
2479,I can even monitor my stats to see what I can make for improvements or data collection.
2480,I can make or delete pages anytime I would feel.
2481,See notifications etc.
2482,What I don't like is the bugs and errors when I want to edit something.
2483,Its frustrating and I think it may factor in in messing up my set up.
2484,Nice app Great app for keeping up with all kinds of info.
2485,"Cloud sync is wonderful, so I have my notes on any device I'm using."
2486,Saved me many times when I needed to transfer files.
2487,Update.
2488,Took a star away due to the really awkward method implemented for editing notes.
2489,Spending way too much time prepping or cleaning up notes in the desktop app.
2490,Update: took another star away due to the poor design issues I'm dealing with.
2491,Sync is hidden and hard to get to.
2492,Still having the edit problems.
2493,May have to start looking for a different solution.
2494,"Downgrades Images This is mostly a good app as it allows management of diverse files in a notebook, however it by default downgrades images created by Skitch and placed in an Evernote note, so when you go to 'annotate' a saved HighRes image, you will find that it has artifacts of being resized."
2495,"This is HORRIBLE behaviour, and when I noted such to Evernote they basically gave me a runaround and didn't fix the problem and closed the ticket and quit responding."
2496,This of course only followed repeated attempts to UPSELLING me first.
2497,It's ok Best option that I've found but it could use some upgrades.
2498,"If you use the bullet points and increase the indent for organization, it deletes it once you save it."
2499,"All of the bullet points revert back to the left side, which makes it hard for class notes."
2500,It would be nice if you could have notebooks so that you don't have to scroll to the bottom of the notes every time.
2501,"That way you can have a book titled ""history"" and then inside that book you can have ""exam 1 notes"", ""exam 2 notes"" etc."
2502,"I used LG QuickMemo previously, but then I changed devices and after a painful (had to be pdf images->txt via OCR) but eventually successful migration of notes to new phone I decided to use a more renowned app for notes, figured it will work for the future when I change phones again.. import was successful, but I am disappointed with the search function - it seems it didn't index the old notes correctly, especially when there is no internet connection the search just doesn't work!"
2503,Please fix..
2504,"Forced to create a ""Note account""..."
2505,"Between my bank account, my phone account, my Facebook account, my Netflix account, my email account, my Google account... you guys want to bug with a stupid ""Note account"" ?"
2506,Come on !
2507,Do you think I haven't enough accounts and passwords to remember the existence ?
2508,That my digital life isn't fragmented enough ?
2509,"I don't need to ""sync my notes across all my devices"" nor to back them up, an Evernote account should be OPTIONNAL, thanks."
2510,Kinda Liking it After Springpad!
2511,The conversion from Springpad was effortless!
2512,"Luv the ability to easily bookmark pages, formatting, add notebooks& tags& comments & shortcuts, etc."
2513,"The one thing I miss that Springpad had is, when I typed in a tag, Evernote doesn't pull up existing tags with that word...so it's a major inconvenience to scroll thru a long list of tags."
2514,It'd also be nice to have an Undo button.
2515,Add those & I'll upgrade my rating.
2516,Keep up the great work!
2517,Limited without annotation options on images Doesn't appear to be any way to add markups or annotations on images that are captured.
2518,"Using it on LG G4, the built in Quick Memo app seems more capable and easier."
2519,Guess it's primarily intended for text note taking.
2520,"Odd that the terms say a paid subscription cannot be cancelled after starting it, though that doesn't apply to the free trial."
2521,"""You will not be able to cancel the subscription once activated."""
2522,editing note in android app destroys formatting I often create notes in Evernote Mac which contain hierarchical/nested todo's (using Evernote checkboxes).
2523,"If I view the note in Evernote Android, all is well, however if I choose to *edit* the note in Evernote Android, all indentation immediately disappears."
2524,The loss of indentation is permanent and is synched to all my devices.
2525,"Evernote vs keep Although Evernote is far better then google keep on many fronts, few small things makes me use keep."
2526,"List options in keep, checked items moves to bottom."
2527,Archiving of my notes etc.
2528,Widget option to view only selected notebook.
2529,Please add these features for five stars.
2530,I was really excited about this app when I first started planning a road  trip overseas.
2531,There are a lot of places I searched for to pin that the app  didn't find.
2532,It's search feature could use a lot of improvement.
2533,But the  deal breaker for me was found when I tried texting the offline navigation  in my home city the other day.
2534,I searched a location on the other side of  the city.
2535,"The app only offered me one option for a route and, as a local,  it's not one that I would ever take - neither fastest nor shortest  distance."
2536,"I started out on the route anyway and then purposefully deviated,  waiting to see how it would handle the route change."
2537,The answer is not  well.
2538,"It directed me to turn around for the next several minutes even  though I was headed towards a major freeway, which was closer."
2539,"If I'm using  this overseas and a road is closed for whatever reason, this app is never  going to help me get around the detour."
2540,Im going to have to figure it out  myself.
2541,"Even after I got on the freeway, navigation continued to try to  route me off at the next several exits, which would have been way out of  the way."
2542,I'm super disappointed.
2543,Will definitely be trying another app  instead.
2544,Are you kidding me !?
2545,"Tbh the app looks great ... Alot of options , nice UI ..."
2546,"But the problem is  , "" I can't upload any posts to my wordpress site with this app "" .... Gosh !!!!"
2547,U guys kidding me ?
2548,"When I try to post something it shows ""Uploading "" for around 50 seconds and after that it always shows. """
2549,"post upload failed : An error occured while uploading the post ""  Even if the post contain just a heading and 3 lines of content ( no media files ) the result is same."
2550,"For gods sake , plz fix this bug ASAP."
2551,"Great potential but needs bug fixes Of course, I like the idea of having an off-line map."
2552,I downloaded a few of them.
2553,"They seem fairly accurate, easy to read and have a lot of very useful details by default without decreasing the readability."
2554,So from that point of view I would give at least 4 stars.
2555,"Now it keeps freezing on me if I touch any of the controls Search, Download Maps (I can download only by using the map itself), Settings at the bottom of the screen."
2556,Also some details (such as shops and bus stops are missing) and at least in one case a bus stop would show only at a specific scale.
2557,So I am only giving 3 stars right now but there is a great potential for an excellent app... PS.
2558,And I also like the fact they try to answer most of the reviewers when appropriate!
2559,No tech support I was simply writing a note and all of the sudden I got a message that the note cannot be loaded.
2560,Due to some unknown error... Blah blah blah.
2561,So I looked to contact Evernote and get some help and I am NOT able.
2562,"Evernote if you are out there, I would appreciate being contacted so that I can resolve this problem."
2563,I needed the reminders found in the note for today and I do not have them.
2564,So my list of things to do for today is shot.
2565,Thank you.
2566,I do hope you can help.
2567,I have been pleased with Evernote up to this point.
2568,But you really do need to work on technical assistance and helping customers that run into problems.
2569,I have given you an hour that I did not have and still there is no solution.
2570,😞
2571,Trying to use Evernote for shopping list.
2572,Editor stinks!!!
2573,There's no undo.
2574,And it continually deletes blank lines that I use to group items.
2575,"Doesn't matter which device I use: web, tablet, or phone."
2576,"Also, cursor jumps around: when I add a blank line in the middle of my list, cursor often jumps to the end and adds line there (not where I intentionally placed my cursor.)"
2577,About to give up with this and switch to OneNote.
2578,Update - Now I keep getting update email notifications - WHY???
2579,It hasn't changed!
2580,"Leave me alone, Evernote!"
2581,And now I can only use on two devices?
2582,Definitely uninstalling.
2583,Switched to Wunderlist.
2584,It was great till a year back.
2585,"But now, TYPING, COPY-PASTING TEXT, EDITING ALREADY CREATED TEXT NOTES etc has become very difficult."
2586,App just freezes / hangs / typing stops.
2587,This is more frequent it try to edit an already existing note.
2588,I have to use WEB for editing.
2589,"Please make THE WHOLE APP more light, & make EDIT PANE more native to Android architecture."
2590,"Tried reinstalling app, restarting device, deleting data."
2591,"Happening in both device: Samsung Galaxy M30s Mobile, & Samsung Galaxy Tab S5e."
2592,Good app to collect data and sync it.
2593,Customizable.
2594,"Last version is very laggy, may freeze on premium quadcore (mi5s+) for ten seconds with ease."
2595,Premium user for more than 3 years.
2596,"See no alternative, though :-) UPD: Starts to freeze on the top Samsung tablet (Sm-t825)."
2597,"UPD2: may take up to a few minutes to open ""few lines of text"" note."
2598,UPD 2: cannot sync for tree days on wifi and 5 notes I edited on device.
2599,Gross.
2600,"Premium tablet 2 years old (Samsung sm-t825), the only app on device."
2601,Latest update data hog Latest software update used my network data to automatically download updated maps.
2602,No warning.
2603,Can't find an option to only update maps via wifi.
2604,Default should always be to update via wifi with option to use network data.
2605,Result I went over my 2GB allowance and got dinged for overage.
2606,I am not impressed.
2607,App is good otherwise but this for me is a significant flaw.
2608,It's coming off my phone until it's fixed.
2609,"Despite developer response, I just confirmed no warning message when download over mobile network."
2610,Less and less impressed I am less and less impressed the more I use evernote.
2611,I tried using this app on my Infinity Android Tablet PC in place of OneNote during a meeting at work.
2612,"At one point, I selected some text and tried to indent it."
2613,No indent button to be found.
2614,"Tried pushing the tab key, hoping that like windows, it would indent the selected text."
2615,NO!
2616,Instead it deletes all the selected text and puts in its place a single tab.
2617,"Not what I was after but no worries, let me just undo that... wait, where's the undo button?"
2618,Undo!??!?
2619,"You guessed it, no undo."
2620,Notes are permanently lost.
2621,"This happened again during the meeting, I accidentally deleted a block of text with a careless click."
2622,"No undo, text gone."
2623,Useful valuable notes just gone.
2624,"Not to mention odd problems like selected text not actually changing to bold or italic on occasions when clicking the bold/italic buttons make this a frustrating, unhelpful experience."
2625,I can't even integrate drawings into my notes.
2626,"Skitch allows you to ""attach"" a drawing but it can't be inline with the notes that they relate to."
2627,They're all bunched on at the end.
2628,Evernote?
2629,"For short, quick notes?"
2630,Sure.
2631,For actual note taking?
2632,Not happening
2633,Could be better Came installed on my Note Pro 12.2 and came with premium so I had high expectations.
2634,Update appears to only have changed the appearance.
2635,It's the only app that does handwriting and will multi-screen so I can edit a PDF in Papyrus (highly recommend) while taking notes so I guess I can't complain too much.
2636,The pages for handwriting are intensely small and the pen width is grotesquely huge so you can't fit much.
2637,"Even after the update, the pen is still oppressively huge."
2638,"Also, you have to back out of handwriting to save the document so if you accidentally close the app you get to start over."
2639,Only 4 pen colors.
2640,No highlighting.
2641,No eraser size choice.
2642,Cut tool is very clumsy.
2643,S-pen and fingers have the same functions.
2644,Can't export to PDF.
2645,Can't move handwriting from one page to another.
2646,It's no Papyrus but it'll do for my needs until I find something better.
2647,Really close up zoom.
2648,Very poor palm rejection.
2649,"Gets worse with every update On launching Evernote, I have to dismiss a full-screen plug for a feature I don't care about."
2650,Half of the notes list is then taken up with another plug for a feature that I must dismiss.
2651,And now adding a new note just shows a menu of note types rather than just adding a text note and letting me change the type.
2652,Editing a note requires dismissing YET ANOTHER plug for a feature I don't care about.
2653,"Either STOP CONSTANTLY HUSTLING YOUR CUSTOMERS or give us a simple option to turn this rubbish OFF, PERMANENTLY."
2654,Only clips the URL of the web page in Android.
2655,This is really frustrating.
2656,"On my desktop, using the Chrome add on,  the web clipper works well, discards useless page parts and saves the article in readable form."
2657,"This Android version only sends the URL of the page to Evernote, nothing else."
2658,I have to use Pocket application to save the page contents and from there send it to Evernote..
2659,If pocket had a decent filing system I would ditch Evernote in a millisecond.
2660,For darn sake improve the Android version.
2661,"Not my first choice Several years ago I looked at Evernote as a GTD application and found it difficult to use, and as a result implemented my system in SpringPad."
2662,With the demise of SpringPad I have been forced back into Evernote and have tried for a few months to adjust but continue to struggle.
2663,The most important is the ability to filter the notes in a notebook based on the tag.
2664,"Unless I’m missing something, I only seem to have the choice of listing notes by notebook OR tag in Evernote."
2665,What I would like to be able to do is bring up a list of note within a particular notebook based on a selected tag.
2666,"The idea being that I have a notebook for all my To Do’s, but only what to look at that list based on the context of where I am."
2667,So I have a list of To Do’s that are tagged as at home or at work.
2668,"So when I am at work, I what to be able to look at my To Do list that is only relevant to when I am at work."
2669,There are other situations where this is extremely useful.
2670,The other significant SpringPad feature that I would like you to consider is to be able to filter out completed tasks.
2671,I can't do something as simple as create a clean formatted monthly checklist.
2672,There are check boxes to use but at the start of the next month I have to manually uncheck all items.
2673,I also can't set a recurring reminder.
2674,A fully functional to do list manager is the least any note taking app should be.
2675,Even though I tried this with different keyboards it's editing capabilies are poor.
2676,They don't come up to any of the external editors that I have on my tablet.
2677,Compared to the pc/web version this is crippled.
2678,"One reason I would like an external editor is that I have a lot more formatting capability and the ability to 'snapshot' or, for example, undo deletions."
2679,"rather than sweat coding more editor functions, simply flipping into an more capable external editor seems sensible."
2680,There are a lot of management features in the PC/web version that I consider very basic.
2681,being able to edit the raw HTML code to correct errors or carry out formatting that the 'visual' mode doesn't permit is one.
2682,"Again, this might be resolved with an external editor: edit in visual/text or in html switch."
2683,Perhaps the simplest demonstration of what's lacking is to run the tablet and the PC/web version side by side.
2684,"I realize there is a screen real estate issue, especially when trying to run this on a 4.5 inch phone, but perhaps that's a case of ""you shouldn't be doing that""."
2685,However other applications I use do have panels that pull down or pull in from the side.
2686,... out of space ...
2687,This app becomes more and more idiotic.
2688,"Stats are badly organized, slow and do not give relevant data."
2689,Posting and editing tools are worthless.
2690,This last stupid update is enough for me.
2691,Uninstall.
2692,"Edit: I used this app for stats, and implementing ""Insights"" was bad!"
2693,Loading is slow and with the last update you cannot view individual posts.
2694,"New Wordpress post editor in a browser lacks a lot options, in app even more: options missing concerning pictures, buttons for formatting hidden... 500 limit"
2695,There are so many things the FAQ & tutorial don't explain.
2696,"It's impossible to join a party without having to be sent some scan thing, I'm unable to go on quests, there's no explanation about the weapons you equip (does adding 3 points to my intelligence even do anything since there's no skills?)"
2697,The challenges are a joke (I saw one where your challenge was to join their group.
2698,How do you consider that a challenge?)
2699,"I still haven't figured out what silver does or what benefit you get from marking a task as ""trivial,"" AND I'm unable to see how long it's been since I last checked off a task, so I might end up accidentally marking it twice."
2700,It's a mess.
2701,Address search I had no trouble  understanding the instructions for entering an address search.
2702,Because I never found any such instructions.
2703,The developer's quick reply to those 2 sentences was simple but ineffective.
2704,"""Enter the country name"" etc etc?"
2705,"Ah, they redefined the problem!"
2706,Enter the info where?
2707,"The search icon opens a drop down list, but does not appear to open a blank to enter anything."
2708,Wait!
2709,Wait!
2710,One can click on what looks like the list's title bar and type in an address?
2711,Why not say that in the first place?
2712,OK now we're getting some place.
2713,"Your info - enslaved, and you pay and pay I was very excited about the free version at first."
2714,"Great interface, features, stability, and cross-platform support."
2715,Then I tried to access offline a note I just written and found that the free app is immediately useless without constant connectivity.
2716,"Worse, there is no ""export all notes"" or ""export notebook"" to an open file format should I decide years (and thousands of notes) later that I want to go with a different product."
2717,Make no mistake.
2718,Everpay is all about user (and company) lock-in.
2719,Useless for anything important if you need offline access.
2720,Looking for a replacement app Had to delete my 5 star review from '12.
2721,Evernote lost its way.
2722,Too many updates & unneeded changes.
2723,"The app throws in extra lines, delete jumps around, etc, tons of quirks right now."
2724,"UPDATE - A new error: ""The text of this note is too long for editing."
2725,"Please use Evernote on your computer to edit it."""
2726,Really?!
2727,That is just the latest in crashes & roadblocks Evernote is throwing my way.
2728,So long Evernote.
2729,It was good for a while but frustrating the last 6 months.
2730,"Multiple crashes, loss of data, on Android today."
2731,How to submit a report???
2732,"So, collected the log, mailed to support.evernote."
2733,Bounced.
2734,"Tried to submit via their websire: 'unavailable, please try again some other time.'"
2735,Tried via the 'Send logs and notes' in the App.
2736,: it led nowhere.
2737,I honestly have never seen a mainstream app without any way to submit a problem report.
2738,"This was a loss of data, lock and crash event: why wouldn't the company have some way to submit an error report?"
2739,"When Evernote started, it was a beautiful and very useful app."
2740,Until they turned into a desperate money seeking app.
2741,"Months ago after an upgrade, I was notified I cant view my notes if I am offline."
2742,Now their strategy is that I must subscribe to premium before I can access any of my notes.
2743,The rate is quiet high depending on your volume of Notes.
2744,"If I am pushed to the wall, and I subscribed..."
2745,I reserve my comments on what will happen... Pls the app developer should be considrate.
2746,Edit: dropping to 1 star since they're getting greedy and now you have to pay to sync devices whereas before you didn't.
2747,"It's annoying that there's no formatting consistency between the desktop version, website, and app."
2748,"If I create a note using the website, and then continue to edit it on my android, the formatting of the new text changes (size is smaller etc) so I have to go back on the website (using my laptop) to fix it."
2749,Please fix these annoying issues
2750,"I just updated it & can't find the TEXT FORMATTING BAR which contained BOLD FONT, UNDERLINE, HIGHLIGHT, BULLETS, SUBSCRIPT, SUPERSCRIPT."
2751,How am I gonna keep editing my notes without text formatting????
2752,This NEW VERSION IS TRASH.
2753,Please DEGRADE TO THE OLDER VERSION.
2754,ALSO NOTES TAKE AN ETERNITY TO LOAD.
2755,No one had asked for an update in the first place.
2756,VERY MUCH UNSATISFIED!!!!
2757,!
2758,"Still Frustrating and Flawed After Several Years I feel that, unfortunately, the only good thing this app has to offer is having access to your notes from all devices."
2759,"Other than that, it's generally frustrating to take notes that require any sort of diagrams."
2760,"The whole ""shape prediction"" system is highly flawed, and should be replaced with polygon drawing tools."
2761,"I should not have to draw an imperfect circle, wait for the program to think, ""hey, that's circle-like, here's a circle button,"" and then when I go to press said button, a mark appears where the button was, forcing me to go back and attempt again."
2762,"This will happen many, many times before it actually registers the button press, and usually by the time that has happened I've lagged behind in the notes and should have just moved on."
2763,"Now that I'm using it on a Samsung Note Pro 12.2, having pen input is great, but the thinnest available line is still too thick for my tastes."
2764,"I have been using this app for several years in classes, starting on the first generation Asus Transformer, and there really hasn't been any changes or updates made since then."
2765,Their logo makes one think that an elephant never forgets; apparently an elephant doesn't learn new tricks either.
2766,Have used Evernote as a nice tool for clipping and quick notes etc.
2767,"However, when it came to REALLY needing a bit of power in order to make a list with some photos, text and URLs attached the Android app performed ABSOLUTELY SHOCKINGLY."
2768,"Kept resetting my text with random edits, replacing my cursor randomly etc."
2769,"HUGELY glitchy to the point where it gained the ultimate badge of dishonour for a terrible product: that moment where your productivity has been thwarted to the point where you feel like not continuing, but throwing the device out the window."
2770,Hope they can address this problem as it fatally ruins what should be a go to productivity tool.
2771,No way I would ever consider returning to premium in this guise.
2772,Perhaps they can speak to Microsoft and ask how they resolved such glitches with Notepad and Word 25 years ago?
2773,"Looks good, but 1."
2774,"It's overbloated with useless features (chat, connect to FB, Twitter...) but it is missing important features - export to PDF and share (in normal way like every other app do)..."
2775,"I don't want to ""invite others to Evernote"" and I don't like public link too."
2776,2.
2777,Without access to my notes offline and ability to search I cannot consider it a serious app.
2778,If I put my important notes there - I cannot rely on network coverage to access it.
2779,"(premium is too expensive - I can pay 1 time fee, not monthly)"
2780,Best app on Google Play Evernote is my favorite service online.
2781,"I've tried so many other, similar services and always end up coming back."
2782,"This app works well, and the widgets make it even better."
2783,I've yet to have a crash.
2784,"I wish that the location tagging of notes allow you to specify a location using its name, instead of just a pin on a map, for example being able to tag a location as my works name and make that metadata searchable."
2785,"severely flawed app I was favorably impressed with the quality of the maps that came with Maps with Me Light; so, I ordered the full version."
2786,"However, I found that full version severely flawed."
2787,"While the program correctly identified my being at my home, and while it correctly identified the name of the street I was on, when I tried to search for my full address, including the house number, it could not find the address and suggested similarly named streets in other towns."
2788,"When I asked for the Walgreen pharmacy, it identified such pharmacies in distances of over 4 miles, but failed to identify the pharmacy that is less than half a mile from where I was."
2789,"When I asked for restaurants, it failed to identify the 99 Restaurant two blocks away from my home, while identifying another restaurants offer the same chain, several miles away."
2790,"In my opinion, the application completely failed the test."
2791,"If I were in an unfamiliar city, (which is the point of a mapping application), I need to find the nearest gas station, ATM, pharmacy, or a specific address."
2792,"If I cannot rely on Maps with Me to do that, I have no use for it."
2793,I have requested cancellation of my purchase.
2794,"Decent but Android is lagging I use evernote all the time on many devices (OSX, iphone, ipad, Note 10.1) and it's a great service but their Android implementation definitely feels like it lags behind the other platforms."
2795,"It's largely in the interaction details, things like notes auto-exiting ""edit"" mode while I'm in the middle of meetings and the lack of formatting feature parity (can't select multiple lines of ""bullet"" items, can't indent checkboxes)."
2796,"Definitely worth using, but I'm hoping they bring the note editing on Android up to the same polished level as they have elsewhere."
2797,Been using Evernote for 7 years now.
2798,I love it.
2799,I love the cloud based notes n all.
2800,What I don't like is the lack of ease when it comes to editing.
2801,Sometimes you have to log into a computer to do simple stuff like auto double space.
2802,They took away a lot of features they now make you pay for like multiple devices.
2803,"But as an app as a whole, point and text basically, I still love it."
2804,Its auto save feature is immaculate.
2805,Never once had to worry.
2806,So.
2807,Enjoy it as much or more than I do.
2808,Mine is ad fre
2809,"App used to be a solid 5/5, but they pushed out an update that removed functionality that I relied on heavily (widgets daily)."
2810,"I have a subscription so I wasn't caught off by the mobile access counting as one device (on the 2 device access limit), but the new update increased loading times as well on Android."
2811,When I used Widgets and I could have a note ready to go in a second.
2812,Hoping they get back to what the old version was soon.
2813,The more functions get added the less I like using the app.
2814,"Its pretty obvious they're really pushing premium features trying to compete with OneNote, which is a shame."
2815,I liked having a simple note app with check boxes.
2816,"Now it's an extra click to the check boxes, while extra screen space is taken up with unnecessary options for formatting and auto indentations etc are making editing my notes messy."
2817,I'd like an evernote lite.
2818,Excellent(?)
2819,"OK, I am an ex-springpad user and the current version of EN never ceases to disappoint me."
2820,"The app does not allow to do basic things like deleting folders, bulk action on notes, it syncs slowly, the basic function of tap-to-edit so common in ALL the other note taking apps is missing."
2821,Having access only to mobile devices right now (no stationary PC or laptop) I am saddened THIS is the best alternative.
2822,Need more control of what gets cached on device.
2823,"Storage use on my tablet was 1gb plus and crashing my tablet with no easy way to either 1) unsync folders en masse, or 2) move database to sd card."
2824,"Only real option was to uninstall, which worked."
2825,Trying now to reinstall and sync no notebooks...  control of storage space and networ usage should be basic features.
2826,Come on guys...
2827,Overall good Pretty good app.
2828,I don't like that you have to upgrade to premium just to be able to view your notes offline.
2829,Plus I wish when you scroll through a note and hit edit it didn't take you back to the beginning of the note.
2830,Text getting garbled when editing a note with check boxes.
2831,Cannot send a log via email as the TO field doesn't contain an email address.. No other way to contact Evernote for feedback.
2832,🤷🏻
2833,The update buried the feature I use most in the app This app was great until the last update.
2834,The part of the app that I used the most was the admin page access.
2835,It was always the first thing I looked at whenever I opened up the app.
2836,"I maintain several WP sites for myself, both business and personal."
2837,I use the app for when I don't want or have time to sit down at my pc to do updates.
2838,Where I thought the app shined was maintaining my WP sites.
2839,The app allowed me to be able to easily cycle through all my sites quickly to see if they needed plugin or WP updates.
2840,"After selecting the admin option, I could click each site and within minutes have all the sites updated, significantly quicker than using a pc to do it."
2841,"With the latest update to the app, the developers buried the admin page access 3 clicks deep, so what would take me 1 click + a click per site to check update status, now requires me to click into the settings, then 2 clicks per site to check for update status."
2842,I considered this app a 5 star app before this bizarre change.
2843,I'm hoping it was an oversite or test on the developers part and that they'll fix this in the next update.
2844,"Otherwise, at least in my opinion, they've partially crippled the app."
2845,Almost perfect.
2846,But this app needs some improvements.
2847,I am a premium user and this is the most annoying thing I found in evernote.
2848,I am looking forward the next update with these improvements.
2849,I use a lot of bullet points and I always have a problem when I want to copy all text under bullet points.
2850,I know that user have to first get out of an edit mode then you can copy all text.
2851,"But when you paste your text , it does not bring bullet points and all your notes is messed up."
2852,This is so annoying.
2853,( where can I send an email to the developer i want to write more
2854,MY notebooks right?
2855,A sluggish software that can't decide if it's a notepad or a word processor.
2856,notebooks need to be paid for so that when you sync you won't need to open notes one by one for offline viewing.
2857,"With the count of them being my notebooks you'd think I'd get to view them, but no, they made it hard."
2858,"When editing, you'll be placed back up a note."
2859,*facepalm* you'll have to re-navigate just to edit.
2860,If they actually used this app instead of only finding ways to make money then they'd have a better app.
2861,Updates have ruined this app The sharing option has been turned into a mess.
2862,With the app handling email and all sharing internally.
2863,Want to email a copy through your standard email app?
2864,Nope evernote thinks it can do that better.
2865,How about make a copy of a note so you can have a saved template to work off of later?
2866,Gone.
2867,I'm annoyed with how deep I've gotten into using this app to only have to start looking to other apps for simple note taking function instead of an app that's trying to be everything.
2868,I have enjoyed using Evernote except for one extremely annoying issue.
2869,"When in area without Internet access & spotty cell phone coverage and you try edit or update a Note, it will ""Lock"" the note!"
2870,You can't ever edit that note again.
2871,(Error msg says note was created in another app...
2872,"It wasn't) Hey, Evernote Developers!"
2873,Time to fix this!
2874,"If it ""Locks"" then there should be a way to ""Unlock"" a note!"
2875,I have researched this & people have been complaining about this since 2016!
2876,"Let us ""Unlock"" notes!"
2877,I'm with most other people here.
2878,All of my Notes have had their creation date reset to the date of the last sync.
2879,All of my shortcuts no longer work.
2880,"Sharing to Evernote opens the whole app which, invariably, is still saving the last note I added."
2881,"I keep seeing the ""getting your new app ready"" splash screen."
2882,Please pull this new app until its fixed.
2883,As a long term customer I'll be looking for a refund of my subscription and an alternative product
2884,Editing my review I was a paying loyal user for years and I was sorry to have to bump back down to a basic account.
2885,"Mostly because I can barely use Evernote now, at least not without being bombarded by pop ups and banners and ads telling me to upgrade back to premium."
2886,Oh and on the two device limit : I get an email EVERY.
2887,single.
2888,time I need to revoke a device.
2889,This app is so intrusive and distracting to work on.
2890,I give up.
2891,It's been pretty five star for the time I've been using it.
2892,But now the mobile app has a bug which has made it pretty unusable for me at all - on occasion (maybe 30% of the time?)
2893,"when attempting to press the little tick mark on the top left to save and close the note, the keyboard will drop down, but leave a white box and the whole app will freeze."
2894,"The only way to make it work again is to close it and reopen, and the note is lost."
2895,"I've had one too many instances of forgetting to copy the contents of an important note JUST in case this happens, and I'm just going to go to another app so I don't have to deal with losing things all the time."
2896,"In addition, I've found out that trying to privately inform Evernote of a bug that is causing me to stop using their product is a paid feature."
2897,This is the only way I know of to contact them.
2898,This app is not as good as other note keepers that I've used.
2899,The interface is clunky and not intuitive.
2900,"Also when using shared notes, if you are revoked access or the shared note is deleted, it still shows up with no way to delete or remove from view (can't do it on web either)."
2901,This is aggravating if you are using this app to keep organized.
2902,Also you cannot contact support unless you have an upgraded account.
2903,And the FAQ page is lacking.
2904,Overall many improvements needed for me to keep using...
2905,Huge Gaps There are huge gaps in the usability.
2906,"It is very complicated to create a note from an image one shares from a web browser, because it keeps creating a note with the image's url, instead of attaching the actual image."
2907,"This means one needs to save the image in the web browser, and the manually attach the saved image."
2908,This takes way too much effort and is enough to discourage me from using Evernote.
2909,"Most convenient note-taking app Great service, but the formatting bugs are starting to annoy me."
2910,"I save a note and come back to see that the numbering is off: every line has the same number, or the numbering starts over halfway through the list, or that one line has two numbers and you can't fix it without completely deleting the numbering."
2911,You also can't select text from multiple bullet points at once which makes copying and pasting a hassle.
2912,"Lastly, notes don't update immediately from one device to another."
2913,Updates are a fail Recent updates to Evernote (within the last 2 weeks) have made it impossible to edit existing notes from my android device.
2914,"After clicking the pen icon in Evernote, I get a blank Evernote page that asks what i would like to remember."
2915,I can't see my existing note & can't get back to it.
2916,I'm taken (w a delay) to a number of other unusable screens that freeze up.
2917,I have to keep trying to back out of Evernote.
2918,"Prior to 2 weeks ago, I would have given this app 5 ★."
2919,I loved it.
2920,Mixed feelings I have used this apps for extensive note taking for quite some time.
2921,"And while I like to be encouraged to switch to a subscription by extra features, but forcing your customers to pay up by removing the core functionality of the app (ability to synchronize across more than 2 devices) is a very ugly business practice."
2922,"I'd prefer if free synchronization were back, possibly at the cost of functionality I'm not using - text& image sync on all devices is all I need."
2923,Doesn't seem to have aged well.
2924,"It's a famous service but falls short on some basic stuff: it's not easy to link notes in between then, and even creating a text link is hard (on the app)."
2925,"On the web it's easy, but it's not clear which links you should use for a note."
2926,The web link doesn't even load on the phone!
2927,Other formatting options are hard to use and different between web and mobile.
2928,"I know this is just part of the app, but one that hit hard for my first impressions."
2929,"thank u evernote team for the most valuable gift a student can possibly have, i.e."
2930,total control over his notes & study matter.
2931,ur webclipper is simply magic.
2932,i m pretty satisfied with this app.
2933,but i have 2 suggestions: 1. kindly place a scroll bar on the mobile app for easy & quick accessibility of the desired portion of the notes 2. enable changing page colour for easy readibility.
2934,thank u
2935,Some functions simply do not work.
2936,I have been trying to upload images for quite some time and the media simply will not upload.
2937,I Uninstalled and reinstalled the app.
2938,Made sure my themes and plug-ins on my self hosted WordPress blog were all updated .
2939,Checked the dimensions of the image.
2940,There is a progress bar when the image is being uploaded and no matter how many times I try or how long I wait...the image doesn't get uploaded and there is always an error.
2941,"Garbage I just wrote a whole article, the button for inserting images did not respond."
2942,"If I touched the outside of the text box, I couldn't scroll back down to continue my article, no scroll bar for text box."
2943,"When I went to preview the article, it appeared as if it had posted it instead."
2944,"So I pressed the back button to get back and edit, suddenly there was my home screen."
2945,I went back to the app and everything was gone
2946,What's the point?
2947,I can log into my site much faster directly through the web than I can with the app.
2948,It's difficult to edit anything as the screen jumps around when you try to scroll.
2949,If there's a WYSIWYG editor I couldn't find it.
2950,"It added formatting to a post I had started on my computer, which is funny because in the preview all the formatting is stripped."
2951,I'll stick with working directly via the web thank you.
2952,i love this map for hiking and offline information.
2953,"however i have used it for navigation with my motor vehicle and it can rarely find the place im looking for, so i have to search then input the whole address."
2954,i may try again as ive banned all google's nosy prying apps including their maps.
2955,if i retry maps.me I'll post an update.
2956,"Beautiful maps, but lots of problems and missing critical functionality."
2957,"The bad: 1) Won't map to, or even find, an address."
2958,This is a serious deficiency and rules it out as a useful tool for me.
2959,"It couldn't even find the city I live in, and I was literally 2 miles from it."
2960,2) Routing is SLOW.
2961,This makes my decade old tomtom seem speedy.
2962,3) Route time is WILDLY inaccurate.
2963,Over 7 hrs to drive 200 miles by highway?
2964,YGBSM 4) No apparent way to get an alternate route.
2965,I couldn't even find any way to force it to go through a waypoint.
2966,(Another deal breaker for me.)
2967,"5) Since routing time is so inaccurate and lack of alternative routes, no clue whether the actual route it picks is anywhere near reasonable."
2968,The good: 1) Really nice maps.
2969,The best I've seen.
2970,"2) Useful info on POIs including hours, phone, website, etc."
2971,is great.
2972,3) Can use national level overview maps with cities and interstates without any download.
2973,This would be good if all you want is pretty maps with no routing.
2974,I may keep it just so I can see where in the world I am while flying.
2975,Even paper and pencil is better than Evernote !!
2976,Evernote rocks - until you find yourself without internet connection.
2977,"In that case all attachments, pictures, etc... are UNAVAILABLE."
2978,Not fun anymore!!
2979,"If only put the stuf in the paper... As much as I tried to fall in love with this app, I am now abandoning it completely."
2980,"If I buy premium account it would represent the MOST expensive piece of software (if U buy win every 5 years and use mostly opensource, Evernote is twice as much = cca 300$) When you read reviews on net - be adviced: they are mostly written by premium account users or by users with almost all time internet conection."
2981,"Evernote stuff: Please take into consideration to include offline data to free accounts, please."
2982,Notes on web are USELESS if you don't have web access!
2983,!
2984,Completely Useless Now!
2985,Since the new update I can no longer read my notes if I'm offline.
2986,Now Evernote says they have taken away the most useful part of the app (that I use to have access to) and I can have it back if I pay them!
2987,"And it is a monthly fee at that, not a one time purchase."
2988,Two issues: 1.
2989,"How can they take away something I already had, and then charge for it?"
2990,2.
2991,Why should I pay Evernote to read the notes I took all the time to make?
2992,Its not like they put a lot of time or energy into writing these notes for me.
2993,No one makes you pay to reread your notes from a regular old notepad.
2994,Conclusion: do not get this app unless you like to pay money to take notes.
2995,There are many other options out there.
2996,Worst application ever.
2997,I cannot access my notes unless I upgrade.
2998,You can stop me from writing new note.
2999,But how the can you not allow me to use me existing notes.
3000,Scam they are doing.
3001,They read my card number god know from where?
3002,No privacy and no security.
3003,Like beggars asking me to validate my card details so that I can access my own notes.
3004,Never seen such beggars in my life before.
3005,Kindly do not use this app.
3006,Even if you are a paid customer kindly unsubscribe and do uninstall this scam from you phone right now.
3007,frustrating & massively limited!
3008,extremely disappointing!
3009,great potential shackled by inexplicable limitations.
3010,creating notes using firefox on galaxy S4: can't select article OR image OR even the most basic function: copy/save whole page!
3011,only capable of saving url unless u manually copy & paste.
3012,even then it omits images.
3013,"u can add images but not in place, only tiny thumbnails at top of note."
3014,massive space hog - huge app size + cache accumulates everything u save.
3015,in a nutshell: pointless waste of time & space
3016,(5 stars w/ disabled spellcheck) Galaxy S9 (used this app on S6 and LG G4 and loved it) overall excellent app i have used for some years now over multiple devices.
3017,"easy to organize, manage and edit your notes."
3018,great template options and premium cloud service.
3019,my problem is that evernote overrides/bugs out the native spell checker which results in the autoreplace preventing me from typing because EVERY SINGLE KEYSTROKE results in a word injection.
3020,predictive text works on every app but evernote.
3021,"Great on PC, but terrible on Android."
3022,Saved searches do not work correctly at all.
3023,This makes it utterly useless to me.
3024,"My saved searches work fine on desktop, but not here."
3025,Interface is awful and wastes TONS of screen space.
3026,"Instead of a nice condensed list of notes, only 5 notes fit on the screen at a time because of all the useless blank space."
3027,Same for tags.
3028,Hardly any customization for the view.
3029,I don't need to see the date on the note list but I don't have a choice to turn it on/off.
3030,I have had Evernote for years.
3031,I get a new phone & now I cannot access it unless I upgrade to use on all devices!!
3032,I only use it on one device!!
3033,There is a stay with your current plan choice but it's not highlighted so I can't choose it!!
3034,That's some fraggle nackin bullcrap!!
3035,It's a free app!!
3036,I don't need to upgrade!
3037,Then you hijack my info!!
3038,I can't even login!!!
3039,You need to fix the stay with your current plan hyperlink!!
3040,You guys are coming off in a bad light!
3041,!
3042,"I dont know whats up with this new update, but it was definitely a miss guys."
3043,"What some may have thought was a slick new interface, is really just a map without street names."
3044,"I don't know where I'm going or how, and there's no land marks to help me."
3045,"All my notes are jumbled in one space, and I have to manually go to the specific notebook I need."
3046,And taking away the widget?
3047,"Honestly, nail in the coffin."
3048,"Think I'll backup my notes somewhere else, just in case.."
3049,"Frustrated with the latest update to the business card scanning function.The label (phone number, fax, email, etc) only shows when the box is empty."
3050,If you've scanned a business card the only way to check the information is categorised correctly is to cut the text out (to see the label) and paste it back in!
3051,Evernote used to be more productive than free business card scanning software.
3052,Now it is less.
3053,Please fix or I will cancel my premium subscription.
3054,"Has become useless after Dec 17 update Puts up message about needing card space, which takes for ages, which never happened before."
3055,"Crashes when start a note with a photo via the widget, which never happened before."
3056,I used to rely on this as my mobile notebook.
3057,Now it is useless.
3058,How can I go back to earlier version?
3059,"STOP USING YOUR END USERS AS ALPHA TESTERS, DO YOUR HOMEWORK BEFORE LAUNCHING AN ""UPDATE"" YOU CLOWNS!"
3060,Plus button 6 item limit BS Thus app is half broke.
3061,Half the options for adding a note are at ant given time not even an option.
3062,"It's fine to limit the quick select menu to only 6 items, but somewhere on the page you HAVE to give a ""more options"" button to click on to select from all the other options, so as to make them still an option."
3063,Who ever designed this did a really crappy job.
3064,"I love this app in theory, as it has been so useful for the many years I  have been travelling."
3065,"HOWEVER, despite all the effort I have put into the  app with adding new places, it never seems to be able to back up my saved  pins for places I like."
3066,"This is very annoying as when I have changed over  phones, they don't restore along with all my other data."
3067,"When I try logging  into OpenStreetMap on the app, there always says there is an error with log  in."
3068,"SO SO frustrating, especially after the amount I have inputted into the  app."
3069,Relationships work both ways!
3070,!
3071,"Technically, I don't ""dislike,"" this app."
3072,I actually like it quite a bit.
3073,But I'm frustrated to the point of getting rid of it.
3074,Why?
3075,"Because the more you use it, the less useful it becomes."
3076,How?
3077,"When you take notes at work or school, do you just throw them all into one folder called ""notes?"""
3078,No.
3079,You organise them by subject in notebooks.
3080,"Evernote lets you do that, but it assumes that whenever you open it, you're looking for that overstuffed ""notes"" folder rather than one subject in particular."
3081,There's NO OPTION to set Notebooks as the default view.
3082,How has this never been addressed?
3083,How?
3084,It's ridiculous.
3085,It's downright stupid.
3086,It mocks me.
3087,I hate it.
3088,I'm taking it personally as a CHOICE by Evernote you waste my time.
3089,I wonder if One Note can help me here?
3090,Used to be a good note taking app.
3091,"I've been using Evernote for over 2 years, was a great note keeping app but over the last few months the developers have really screwed it over."
3092,"Some current bugs: 1: If you have more than 5 notes and use it on Yosemite retina forget about using Evernote, takes over 5 seconds to even copy and paste something in."
3093,Simply pressed the space bar can take over 5 seconds.
3094,2: Cannot cut simple text out of some notes for reason's beyond me.
3095,3: You cannot edit passworded or encrypted docs on the Android phone anymore.
3096,"Come on guys, wtf are you doing?"
3097,Was a perfectly good note taking server until recently.
3098,"I believe it shouldnt be hard for ""EverNote "" !"
3099,"👍 Sometimes i wanna put my hand-written note on the screen as a widget showing all its details i.e as if its a paper or a sticky note on the home page (bc i need it as reminder but not for a specific time, its mostly stuff i wanna get done with through out a day; like  ""remember to get a gift for your friend"" , i will do it any day during the week when i find a chance, However sometime its more than a note for one subject, so the title only won't be enough) ...2nd: Well, I need this one from time to time: an option to copy/paste from one notebook to another."
