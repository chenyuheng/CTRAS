0,This app is so bright it hurts.
1,"You're trying to read, write and relax, but the blank color scheme reminds me more of the sun hitting my face at 6am than of me relaxing while browsing."
2,"This app doesn't have some sort of front page like imgur has for example, instead all we get is the ""discover"" feature which only promotes bland, vague and uninteresting posts with no personality."
3,Just look at it right now!
4,"Where are the people sharing relatable stories, or video game strategies, or book or tv show reviews or something?"
5,"All the posts featured there are just... unattractive, to say the least."
6,"And it's the only source of new content there is, otherwise you have to look it up manually."
7,"There are no set categories or tags, instead you make them up and unless people type them up exactly like you did they won't see your post, which is counterintuitive and discourages finding new posts or bloggers."
8,People can disapprove or even edit your comments.
9,"That is twisted, discourages freedom of speech and opinion sharing and even allows people to literally put words in your mouth by changing your original comment to whatever they want."
10,"You can't dislike posts or comments, so the voting system is pointless."
11,"You might think otherwise because Twitter and Vine have no downvotes,  but they promote discovery of new content in various ways, while WordPress does not."
12,The search bar doesn't work.
13,I've tried finding my own posts with the exact same title they have and they don't appear.
14,"All of these factors make it feel deserted and lacking of a community, and discourage new users of getting into writing or reading on WordPress."
15,Also there used to be a eay to add a black outline to images; a necessity when the background is white.
16,"Change the profile pic from the app was successful,new pic applied in WordPress web based,but in the blog owner comment reply list the blog owner gravatar still using the old previous profile pic,I wish there will be select all in Comment menu so user can select all spam comment n delete at once.Why if we change public name it doesnt change all the previous public name in older comments with new one!"
17,?the Reader tab have issue it still showing me content from blog site i have unfollow for months!
18,The only use for this app over google is it shows trails and jungle footpaths.
19,After that its 'EFFING USELESS.
20,The pointer spins constantly so you cant tell which way you're facing.
21,"It points 180 degrees out and the blue dotted line follows you, ie it can send you back the way you came and not leave your start point blank....so you still think youre going the right way as youre always attached to the dotted line."
22,"It should let the pointer move away from the dotted line, then you can see youre off course."
23,If you brush the screen it opens a new dropped pin which then deletes the path you were following.
24,I cant bookmark anything.
25,"Theres paths highlighted in red that i didnt add, it constantly directs you to road routes even tho i only want mountain footpaths and have it set to walking."
26,"It does work offline for me which is 1 reason not to boot it just yet but its useless to navigate with, i use it just to look for trails."
27,Thankfully im not getting ads cos thailand auto blocks anything that isnt of profit directly to them.
28,"You need to disable the info sharing, apparently this app sells info on you 20 times more than other apps"
29,"Voice guidance is awful: says keep right/left where I have to go straight, doesn't say exit numbers, doesn't say street names."
30,"Search is poor: shows the list, but how do I check these places on the map."
31,"I click the place and it shows my current location with the option to route to, but sometimes it shows the destination, go figure!"
32,"No alternative routes, not optimal route, it can give the route which includes traffic lights, a couple of left turns instead of short residential road and right turn"
33,"Problems, Problems, Problems!"
34,"------------ First when I installed the app & got some maps, they would disappear from the phone after each re-boot."
35,"So, I wrote to the developer."
36,"No reply after a month, I wrote back."
37,No reply after two weeks.
38,------------- Next I uninstalled & re-installed the app (for the 12th time trying to fix the vanishing maps problem).
39,Now the place in Settings to tell the app where to store the maps is gone.
40,Gone!
41,(The SD is 32 GB and has 31 GB free) I wrote the developer.
42,After a week- no reply.
43,"---------- Uninstall Warning: Each time I uninstalled the app., a large folder (Over 1 GB on mine) was left behind on the phone."
44,One must use a file manager to delete it.
45,--------- I Give Up (Which is too bad because this app is easy to use.)
46,"UPDATE- As shown below, the someone from the developer company posted suggestions."
47,I had already tried (multiple times) what is suggested in the links the person posted.
48,I also had already sent e-mails to the address shown.
49,I will try one more time to contact them (because it looks like a fun & easy app).
50,"If no luck, I'll have to conclude that my phone and this app just won't play well together."
51,UPDATE- Developer replied to this review and asked me for the name I used to contact them.
52,I won't post my e-mail here.
53,(That's not a comfortable thing to do.)
54,I sent a new e-maill to them.
55,I will update the review & star rating when (if) they reply & tell me how to make this application work.
56,"Its good, very useful for walking/hiking."
57,Which OSM is very good for.
58,Could  be better with search results for Car Navigation.
59,OSM doesn't really  support proper Address searching so relying solely on this isn't possible.
60,I have to go back to Google to find actual full addresses.
61,What I would  like to see changed is; - when searching the results show the downloaded  Map Name which can be confusing as it doesn't match the location of the  address.
62,(please remove this) - would be nice to have other map  overlays/textures to choose from.
63,(like osm where it shows house numbers!)
64,- Ability to sort bookmarks by Name rather than just when they were added.
65,(also when searching to show bookmarks in results) - Transport information  Trains / Bus times currently not available for the UK.
66,I almost rated this for stars.
67,"It's a nice, useful app with some gaps--I really like the basic idea and the maps themselves are accurate and occasionally have nice details (for example, airport gate numbers)."
68,"There are some major gaps in searching for foods, shopping, etc., though."
69,Primarily this is just in not having locations.
70,"For example, in one city in Japan I did a search for food and it came up with maybe 3 or 4 places when I was aware of dozens close by."
71,"Since it pretty quickly looks for options further away, I was getting results up to fifty miles away (in Japan, traveling fifty miles can take several hours)."
72,It also missed the biggest shopping center in the area.
73,"Still, it's handy for knowing where you are and had the ability to download sections of the world's you're interested in.the interface is also easy to navigate and it came up with Japanese city names easily even though I was using English letters."
74,"Train stations are well-marked and it's pretty easy to follow along with your reason trip to know how much further you need to go and where to get off (note that the routing itself i s by driving rather than public transport, which would have been a nice feature, but that you can simply see where the tracks are)."
75,Too many ads.
76,Even more than Google Maps.
77,At least most of the features work in a general sense; just not in my area.
78,"EDIT: I understand that advertising is a resource that allows for development to continue, but you must understand the current default implementation makes any features very unappealing and the entire experience unenjoyable."
79,I uninstalled imediately after the second push ad.
80,Push ads are unacceptable in any form.
81,"I am aware you can opt out of most advertising by going to settings and switching off ""Show offers"", but there's no garuntee your app will stop giving other unwanted push notifications, such as the one asking if the user is aware of the bookmarking feature."
82,"DO NOT engage the user outside of the app unless it is for a currently requested function or feature they are actively using, such as continuing navigation while in the background."
83,There are better ways to let users know of features.
84,"For example, highlight the area you want to be noticed and give a brief message when the app is launched."
85,"This is more benificial for you as well, because a user is more likely to follow through when they have already chosen to engage with the app, as opposed to you trying to pull them away from whatever else they may be doing."
86,I wanted to like this app.
87,I'm looking for an alternative to google maps.
88,"The routing is actually ok, although the estimated timings don't take traffic conditions into account."
89,"The offline operation is good, but there isn't really an 'online' mode."
90,If I currently have a good connection I want to be able to search a new area without having to download the section first.
91,But what has killed it for me is that the search is useless.
92,"There us no UK postcode search, which is what I primarily use."
93,"Searching by street name sometimes works, but often comes up empty."
94,"Conversely when there are multiple matches adding extra location details (borough, etc) doesn't narrow the search effectively."
95,"As far as i can tell it treats each term entered separately and at some point if you haven't chosen one of the matches for your first term and keep typing it switches to searching on the second term, ignoring the first."
96,"I only managed to experience the navigation by finding places on Google maps, and then matching the street pattern and zooming to find them manually in this."
97,"I gather it works better in some countries than others, so I'll probably try it again sometime, but for now I'm giving up."
98,The app is pretty handcuffed when compared with the web editor.
99,"The app lacks easy linking to already published posts, a way to copy a previous post, and the mouse support on Android is terrible - formatting buttons and most dialog boxes don't respond to mouse clicks at all."
100,"Basic interaction with the admin side, such as comment moderation and stats are fine, but for actually creating and publishing content, the app is very much a second class citizen compared to the web editor."
101,Full integration of the web editor capabilities would make for a much better experience.
102,This app becomes more and more idiotic.
103,"Stats are badly organized, slow and do not give relevant data."
104,Posting and editing tools are worthless.
105,This last stupid update is enough for me.
106,Uninstall.
107,"Edit: I used this app for stats, and implementing ""Insights"" was bad!"
108,Loading is slow and with the last update you cannot view individual posts.
109,"New Wordpress post editor in a browser lacks a lot options, in app even more: options missing concerning pictures, buttons for formatting hidden... 500 limit"
110,What happened to the full editor??!!!
111,"Went to create a blog post today using my WordPress app and discovered that the editor is some weird, useless version of what it was before."
112,"I can't do anything in it like I can in the web based editor such as indent, center, size/place images, etc....literally every major function but basic typing is gone."
113,Where did it go and how do I get it back?
114,If this is not fixed I am uninstalling the app as it is totally useless to me without the full version of the editor.
115,"As well, the web based editor crashes EVERY SINGLE TIME I do an update to a blog."
116,Makes editing virtually impossible.
117,"- - - I received an automated response to this review which said, ""You can switch back to the app's old editor: Go to App Settings in the app and toggle off the 'Show Visual Editor' option."
118,"However, some of the features you mentioned (such as indenting or aligning text) weren't part of the old editor, either."""
119,- - - Found the setting.
120,That leaves ONLY the HTML editor and does not fix the problem...at all.
121,"And, previously, before this change, the editor in my app and the web based editor were identical in their features."
122,Inferior in every possible way to using the online editor.
123,"This app doesn't allow you to link to your own earlier posts, crashes often, can sometimes delet your whole draft even unsave a previously update and saved page, and has issues previewing images."
124,It also cannot pull the most recent version of you updates which you created with the web editor.
125,"Woe be unto you if you mak long pots, because after a certain size copy/paste stop working and the editor gets so slow you have to wait for the displayed text to catch up to you."
126,"What it does do well is present your stats page, manage the site permissions and let you get a rough draft started."
127,Though it has so many problems I'm just using the MS Office apps for my rough drafts and then copy/pasting into the web interface.
128,I'll probably uninstall this soon because it is basically horrible.
129,"Adds have been added in one of the never versions, don't update if you haven't already!"
130,"It's a good app, but it's NOT a universal map."
131,"It works best if you find your destination address with a browser, as the names in OSM don't always match."
132,"Due to size limits, searching by street numbers is not possible and this severely limits your options."
133,"The app goes nuts if your GPS is broken, and you can't just follow the route by moving the map with fingers, as popups keep reappearing."
134,"Maps.me is best if you just move to points you know in advance, using the best in class bookmark system"
135,"Gallery creation/modification missing, Nexus 4 video upload doesn't work	On the whole, the UI is clear and nicely built, but two basics things I use most are missing/not working: - Creating a gallery necessitates first googling the workaround in their support forums (i.e."
136,"(1) attach multiple photos, (2) save as draft; this uploads images and links them to this post, (3) edit post replacing all code with just [gallery]; this uses all linked images (4) publish) - editing a gallery is impossible (just recreate using workaround) - uploading videos on my device doesn't work (invalid file type error), nor does the ""quick video"" function (can not retrieve media)"
137,Not as integrative as I would hope Three things plague this app for me.
138,"1-You cannot upload on the featured image button, you have to do that on the main screen of the site."
139,"2-You cannot get the edit post link through the app, have to log into dashboard on a browser."
140,I need these links to submit post to my editor through Slack or Trello.
141,3-There is no word count visible.
142,I need that since the sites I write for have a minimum word count.
143,"All three of these would make this a five star app for me, else it is useless for me and I might as well just write through the browser."
144,It's worse sorry Since the last update I can't use my regular photo viewer to choose pictures from my post.
145,I now have a list of images that seem to come from my tablet but not it's sd card; where all my images are.
146,"I have around 30,000 images in various picture folders (I am travelling and have a 128GB sd card in my tablet where my images are stored)  and this update to 3.9 has made choosing images impossible."
147,I have two possible workarounds.
148,Either I upload the images to google or similar and put a link in the post to them.
149,Or my second option is to upload the images in the WordPress app through the media menu item and then choose these images I want in the post using your new chooser interface.
150,Honestly I see what you are trying to do with the new interface but it does limit the user as to how they choose their images.
151,"Handing this task over to the operating system, as it was before, makes more sense and makes your app lighter."
152,Please switch back to the normal way of adding images.
153,Updating posts on tablets and phones has been great with the WordPress app and I feel it's just been made more difficult with this update.
154,The schedule is terrible.
155,Going to event details and back resets your scrolling position.
156,There are way too many events for this simple list representation and filtering doesn't help much.
157,"Search is a joke when you try to find a session because there are many of them with the same name and you have to go to details to see the time, the list is not sorted by time either."
158,Shuttle bus schedule is missing from the app so you have to go to the web version to see it.
159,"I want to give it more stars because the site layout is nice and efficient, but editing posts is awful."
160,The lag is absolutely unbearable.
161,Trying to add a couple of characters takes 5-10 seconds to show up on screen.
162,I've written part of a sentence and it's taken 30+ seconds to post them.
163,Deleting them is even worse!
164,I'm not even a fast typer on the text keyboard.
165,It would be faster to handwrite everything at this point.
166,Stick to the browser version for editing if this is why you want the app.
167,Routes are unstable.
168,While following proposed route I was requested to turn back and follow a new route.
169,"Missing ""do not download"" option in map diwnload dialog window."
170,Unable to configure localisation of the map directory.
171,Menu bar disappears at random?
172,Navigation proposes routes violating the law and mistakes public roads with field roads.
173,After update navigation is much worse.
174,No perspective view despite it is enabled in settings.
175,"Calculating a route is slow, arrival estimation changed from optimistic (below 4h) to pessimistic (over 8h) for a route Krapkowice-Warszawa (Poland, realistic estimate ca 5h)."
176,Rerouting freezes very often.
177,Figured out how to enable perspective view.
178,"I had to disable it, close the app, reopen the app and enable it."
179,I fear of other bugs.
180,Useful but to be improved.
181,1) it's missing a search field.
182,"2) no multi select and upload of multiple images from a single folder, it's either messy all together or one by one."
183,"3) I lost the whole text and images of a new post because of an internet connection error, this should not happen no matter how bad the connection is, offline editing is what users expect from an application vs the web-admin!"
184,4) post settings button is hidden when keyboard is open 5) can't edit site url 6) can't batch upload local charges
185,This app has gone downhill.
186,Now that Google maps supports offline maps there is absolutely no reason to use this app.
187,It still causes my device to restart.
188,"No other app makes my phone restart, only this one."
189,It uses a dodgy background process that makes my phone restart even after I finish using app.
190,"They need to add a ""exit"" button to properly close the app."
191,It keeps running services in background even when I force quit the app via task manager.
192,It crams a lot of junk and annoyances in the app.
193,I don't want business names or the ability to rate or share or whatever other junk they force in there.
194,Let me turn all the junk off so I can use the map like a map.
195,Stop asking me to turn on location settings.
196,"I use offline maps and not interested in going online and ""writing a review"" of map locations."
197,I was really excited about this app when I first started planning a road  trip overseas.
198,There are a lot of places I searched for to pin that the app  didn't find.
199,It's search feature could use a lot of improvement.
200,But the  deal breaker for me was found when I tried texting the offline navigation  in my home city the other day.
201,I searched a location on the other side of  the city.
202,"The app only offered me one option for a route and, as a local,  it's not one that I would ever take - neither fastest nor shortest  distance."
203,"I started out on the route anyway and then purposefully deviated,  waiting to see how it would handle the route change."
204,The answer is not  well.
205,"It directed me to turn around for the next several minutes even  though I was headed towards a major freeway, which was closer."
206,"If I'm using  this overseas and a road is closed for whatever reason, this app is never  going to help me get around the detour."
207,Im going to have to figure it out  myself.
208,"Even after I got on the freeway, navigation continued to try to  route me off at the next several exits, which would have been way out of  the way."
209,I'm super disappointed.
210,Will definitely be trying another app  instead.
211,Effectively useless for cycle routing.
212,I downloaded this to get cycle routing which Google maps doesn't offer in Central America.
213,Maps.Me does do cycle routing but it's effectively useless.
214,"First, it only offers you one route to your destination, so if you were thinking about taking another road, too bad, maps.me will not show you how long that road might be."
215,"You only get the one suggestion and no others, and no way to make it give you other options."
216,"Second, there's clearly a compulsion by the app to avoid anything it thinks is a highway at all costs."
217,So you end up with totally bizarre and out of the way routes when there's a direct road from you to your destination.
218,"This avoidance of highways would be ok if you were given more than one route to choose from, or you could turn off the 'avoid highways' preference."
219,Unfortunately this is not possible.
220,"All of this might be fine in the US or Western Europe, but in Mexico and Central America if a road doesn't have a number (and is nominally a highway) it probably isn't paved."
221,So avoiding anything with a number is basically going to be sending you along a lot of dirt roads.
222,"The app is also then also avoiding lots of rural highways, totally quiet, beautiful, no traffic, two lane roads."
223,"Finally, they made a big deal with an update that made the app display an elevation profile for cycle routes too."
224,"This is a big deal for cyclists, as it's important to know the hills you have in front of you (or at least on the one route the app wants you to take)."
225,"Sadly, this elevation profile is effectively useless too."
226,"The profile had nothing on it to show scale, so you have no idea how high the individual peaks are."
227,There is one number given next to an up/down arrow symbol which I think must be net gain???
228,Or maybe it's total gain??
229,I really have no idea.
230,"And honestly, if you're going to give me one number, give me the highest altitude I'll reach on that route."
231,From there I can guestimate the other climbs.
232,Maybe the app is ideal for driving.
233,Maybe it works better for cyclists in cities.
234,I don't know.
235,"I do know that it's pretty useless for me, except in the rare circumstances that the app and I are in agreement about which road to take."
236,"This app used to be perfect and previously helped me navigate around the world, but after updates these last few months, the app will no longer work offline."
237,"Unless I am connected to wifi, the app hangs on the preloading screen logo."
238,"Consequently, the app is now useless to me."
239,"If I wanted an app that required data and pressured me to to turn on location services, I would use Google Maps."
240,This is disappointing because this used to be my go-to app.
241,Ugh.
242,Every 'update' frustrates me to no end.
243,I have things working as they should... then an update like the latest wrecks everything.
244,Content in limbo.
245,Endless upload errors.
246,Takes forever to post.
247,And... ugh... what happened to my custom image resize controll'?
248,Once upon a time this app worked beautifully and did what it should... you see... people posting from their phones are ON THE GO!
249,I just want to post quickly with no hassle- the control needed but not clutter.
250,"Many times its mobile data, in a remote location."
251,The app used to be lean and mean and do the job perfectly.
252,Now its like it's a mini desktop app that's bogged down with junk.
253,What used to take seconds... select some pics on phone ... share to WP app... add text hit upload and DONE... is now futz with this and that ... fight the awful quirks ...hit post and wait wait wait...error.
254,error.
255,Wrangle things back to where they work again....then get blitzed by the next update
256,Error when uploading imagen to post The media item could not be retrieved.
257,"Error when uploading imagen to post.WordPress Android version: 4.5.2 Android device name: LGE Nexus 5  01 - Configuring Simperium 02 - Already registered for GCM 03 - resetting suggestion tables 04 - reader post list &gt; restoring instance state 05 - reader post list &gt; creating post adapter 06 - reader post list &gt; purging database 07 - reader post list &gt; updating current user 08 - reader post list &gt; updating tags and blogs 09 - trackLastActivity, activityId: My Site 10 -"
258,"App is so-so, value comes from the maps The application has a very limited feature set - basically the only thing that works (well) is showing the zero-cost OSM material."
259,"The app renders OK and quickly, but that is already all there is."
260,"Quite frankly, other apps based on the skobbler engine draw nicely and very smoothly."
261,In many cases the offline cache of Google Maps is good enough (Japan) and in other areas Google Maps data can actually be downloaded explicitly for a defined region.
262,There is massive room for improvement here.
263,"[Adressing the response to the review: It is not that features are ""bad""."
264,It is the lack of features which I am a bit unhappy about.
265,"Combine the (OSM data-driven) features of ""Locus Map"", ""GPS Navigation & Maps"" and ""MapFactor: GPS Navigation"" with the existing feature set and get a very nice app."
266,"Aggregate *more* data, make the OSM data more accessible, see for instance the email conversation we had three months ago."
267,Just as an example - the Triposo applications have offline maps based on the (very nice) Skobbler engine.
268,The data they aggregate is all crowd-sourced (i.e.
269,"of variable quality), but this app adds a tad bit more offline value.]"
270,Used to be a nice app but it seems it is getting worse as time passes.
271,The  latest is that is impossible to sync/transfer your bookmarks.
272,"The help is  outdated giving you wrong indications, making you loose a lot of time."
273,They  say that your bookmarks are in a folder on SD card.
274,No folder and no  bookmarks there.
275,"They say you should sign in to backup your bookmarks in a  safe place, but you can tap all day long on the sign in button, nothing  happens..."
276,"But they also say that if you by miracle manage to sign in,  those bookmarks will not be available on other devices."
277,May be they all  have the same phone from 6-7 years ago and never had to transfer their  bookmarks...
278,They say you can share bookmarks with your friends.
279,"I've  shared one of my many lists via Wi-Fi direct between my devices, but it's  archived and there is no option to import."
280,Now you have to download another  app to extract that archive but still no way to import them...
281,Awful waste  of time...
282,"Too many bugs Ecoing another user, the maps themselves are nice after they finally download."
283,Love that I can view them offline and save data usage.
284,Not much else appeals to me.
285,The search results are odd and difficult to interpret.
286,Voice commands never seem to work.
287,"Once address is inputed, the route doesn't appear."
288,You sit there showing current location only.
289,I can't get miles to work as the setting defaults back to kilometers every time.
290,"Fix the bugs, I love this app."
291,"As it is, it's only good for offline map viewing."
292,I'd pay good money for a WP mobile editor that actually worked.
293,"This is so broken for image controls (legacy doesn't resize at all, acts like it does... visual eats images and never works."
294,Beta.. works but for some DUMB reason has stupid 'random!!!'
295,image resize options.
296,Arrgh! )
297,"so now my workflow on mobile is to use this pile of steaming ... to upload images in the broken beta editor... RANDOM resize the images close enough, publish the post but delete it, then log into the browser editor and resize the images correctly in the library then insert into a new post."
298,Broken but at least (FOR NOW UNTIL ITS WRECKED AGAIN) I have a work around.
299,Too much for too little.
300,I have several sites that run WordPress and finally getting around to reviewing this WordPress app.
301,"To sum it up, it really isn't all that great."
302,The dashboard within WordPress by default allows galleries and custom posts.
303,All this app does is allows you to write a blog and add a photo or video.
304,"There is no setting featured image, adding a gallery and unless you modify the dimensions of the photo you insert, it will maintain the full size."
305,Just log into WordPress via the Web and do your stuff there.
306,The experience of using the app is amazing.
307,"I can access my admin version of the site and start publishing or scheduling, or even adding a draft to set up with getting back with my computer."
308,I can even monitor my stats to see what I can make for improvements or data collection.
309,I can make or delete pages anytime I would feel.
310,See notifications etc.
311,What I don't like is the bugs and errors when I want to edit something.
312,Its frustrating and I think it may factor in in messing up my set up.
313,Garbage!!
314,"App ever Don't know why a big blogger company like WP, creating such a damn s**** app."
315,Just recently install it today but can't even use it nor logged in.
316,"Here's the app bug logs : WordPress Android version: 4.3 Android device name: Xiaomi HM 1SW 01 - resetting suggestion tables 02 - trackLastActivity, activityId: My Site 03 - Number of old stats deleted : 0 04 - NewAccountAbstractOage.onCreate() 05 - trackLastActivity, activityId: Login Screen 06 - GCM Error: INVALID_SENDER 07 - Server response:  08 - NewAccountAbs"
317,I was a bit lost on a tropical island's hill.
318,Used it to find the right path back.
319,"Recent version seemed to be acting perversely, sending one to slip road to exit motorway only to rejoin it."
320,Also no option for using motorway if available.
321,Not good.
322,Also it would be useful to be able to have waypoints and preferred routes and types of roads to avoid.
323,Updated version now doesn't bring up saved favourites when planning route when tapping on To button.
324,"Another feature absent is any indication of the name of the road you are on, or, often, the junction numbers on motorways."
325,"The maps do not always show road names as well, or if they show up, the names will vanish when you zoom."
326,Blatant internal storage hog.
327,"Each time the app is updated, it decides to fill up the internal phone storage, rather than the the SD card."
328,"And following an app update, you then MUST re-download ALL previously downloaded apps, and again, fill up the phone storage not the SD."
329,"At over half a Gigabyte of app and mapping data, this app is just blatantly greedy, and the developers are either too lazy or too incompetent to design an app appropriately to store directly on exterior SD card storage."
330,----------- WHY do I have to download maps again following app update?
331,EDIT: why also the need to automatically start up at boot?
332,"This app is getting very tiresome to use - weekly updates, repeatedly having to download all previous map files after every app update, frequent nag screens."
333,"Just develop a simple app - which works properly, doesn't nag its users, and doesn't gobble up huge amounts of data!"
334,"Love it with a few hicups Good app but has a few issues... 1: When updating the app I loose all my downloaded maps, why not have the app download them for me or perform an update on them."
335,2: After an update I loose my customised locations.
336,3: I want to be able to find my destination using coordinates not just names of places... 4.
337,"It seems to give prescidence to highways even if they a longer route, this isnt a good algorithm..."
338,Otherwise its a good app...
339,I love it and use it daily.
340,Has some UI usability issues.
341,"While doing a search on a street, it's very unresponsive when I press on the street that has already come up in the search results."
342,"Also, no way to enter a street number."
343,Which seems pretty basic and shocking that it doesn't allow user to specify a street number!
344,Disappointing.
345,I just spent 20 minutes trying to enter in the address of a location.
346,"Suggest you hire some UI designers and product managers to do a better job redesigning this app, to be user friendly and make it easy for users to do simple things, like actually entering in an address!"
347,"In response to Developer's ""fixing"" the 2 missing EXAMPLE addresses I listed, that's like a drop  in the ocean."
348,The problem is NOT simply that it couldn't locate the 2 EXAMPLE addresses I listed.
349,The problem is deeper.
350,"It was unable to properly locate an arbitrary, VALID, address."
351,This is something Google Maps can do EASILY.
352,"Based on this rather GLARING defect, I think this largely makes this app unusable for general purpose navigation.."
353,The ads have become very intrusive.
354,An important part of the screen has the ad and it is difficult to select a map function without hitting the ad.
355,It isn't worth it anymore.
356,Trip planning is an exercise in patience.It is repeatedly suggested that I download my current location not the country map I am trying to work with for a vacation.
357,Everything is a charge!
358,The UI is not very intuitive and trying to select a route between 2 bookmarked locations - well - I still haven't figured that out!
359,Really - Google Editor Choice?
360,Methinks not!
361,"Great potential but needs bug fixes Of course, I like the idea of having an off-line map."
362,I downloaded a few of them.
363,"They seem fairly accurate, easy to read and have a lot of very useful details by default without decreasing the readability."
364,So from that point of view I would give at least 4 stars.
365,"Now it keeps freezing on me if I touch any of the controls Search, Download Maps (I can download only by using the map itself), Settings at the bottom of the screen."
366,Also some details (such as shops and bus stops are missing) and at least in one case a bus stop would show only at a specific scale.
367,So I am only giving 3 stars right now but there is a great potential for an excellent app... PS.
368,And I also like the fact they try to answer most of the reviewers when appropriate!
369,"Garbage I just wrote a whole article, the button for inserting images did not respond."
370,"If I touched the outside of the text box, I couldn't scroll back down to continue my article, no scroll bar for text box."
371,"When I went to preview the article, it appeared as if it had posted it instead."
372,"So I pressed the back button to get back and edit, suddenly there was my home screen."
373,I went back to the app and everything was gone
374,"Ever since the block editor was introduced, editing images and aligning it the way I want it to be is tough on my phone and I have to rely on my laptop for it."
375,"There's a particular layout I prefer and despite whatever tweaking I do, when the post is published, things aren't aesthetically how I want them to be."
376,Earlier I had the freedom to just type stuff out and add images and publish it.
377,Of course less options existed for formatting&alignment.
378,The app is still quite user-friendly though.
379,What's the point?
380,I can log into my site much faster directly through the web than I can with the app.
381,It's difficult to edit anything as the screen jumps around when you try to scroll.
382,If there's a WYSIWYG editor I couldn't find it.
383,"It added formatting to a post I had started on my computer, which is funny because in the preview all the formatting is stripped."
384,I'll stick with working directly via the web thank you.
385,MALWARE APP!!!
386,": IT SENDS YOU VIRUSES AND SPAMWARE Y 30 DIFFERENTE LANGUAGES, THE ANTIVIRUS DETECTS IT AS MALWARE, STAY AWAY!!!"
387,REPORTED !!!
388,I do not want popups asking me if I have thought about where I am going this weekend.
389,Deleting it now.
390,Remove this idiotic nonsense and I will reinstall and re-rate it.
391,also: CRASHES CONSTANTLY WHEN GOING TO SETTINGS.
392,no audio instructions for turn by turn navigation?
393,offline search is poor.
394,download of maps extremely slow.
395,"Markers on map should be ordered by nearest to my location, etc."
396,"Markers search is poor, they re all scrambled."
397,"Just hate it... Not intuitive enough, I made couple of ""mistakes"" that got me headaches."
398,"First one, I started a post, and I wanted to save it, so I pressed the arrow in the up corner to acces next options, but that icon is a ""paper airplane"" that publish the post without even ask!"
399,"Alright, first use..."
400,"I search for something like post adjustments (oh, they were in the footer!"
401,"), and changed the post to local draft."
402,But it NEVER went to draft again in the blog!.
403,"Worst than that, I continued editing it, and the next time I accessed it, a message appeared, something like ""the post is not updated, do you want to?"""
404,"and I thought of course, upload the changes, but what it did was download the first draft (the published one) overwriting the last one so I completely lost ALL of my work."
405,"""Well, let's see the revisions..."" but there's NOTHING like that."
406,"On top of all that, I searched the internet for help, and the only possible solution needed my device rooted before all this, and search some hidden directories, but it comes to happen that there are lots of people who doesn't even know what is to root an android device."
407,ABSOLUTELY AWFUL!!
408,!
409,I like the app and it works well for me to set things up .
410,I have published an about me section and a blog post.
411,It shows up on my end but when I try to view it externally it just says that a new wordpress site is coming.
412,I just wish that when it's published on my end that it also publishes online.
413,Now I have to figure out how to get my blog online so others can view it too.
414,Downloaded this app to use on a trip.
415,It clearly said I had the offline map downloaded yet when I entered in the exact address or a category..
416,It said zero results found even though I knew the address was within my downloaded map.
417,Poor experience.
418,I reconnected with at a McDonald's and only then did the address show up.
419,If this app requires you to have data then google maps is better.
420,"Downloaded thinking this will make mobile site management easier, which it may generally do."
421,"However, the first thing I wanted to do - upload a document to media - seems impossible (or unintuitive if I'm missing something)."
422,The 'add' buttons in the 'media' tab provides filters only for images and videos.
423,There needs to be an option for any file type.
424,For the last God knows how many months I have had no end of problems with this app.
425,"From not being able to upload photos, to my site being hidden when it's quite blatantly not, and not being able to start a new post, oy being able go into setting for about 5 seconds be for it puts me back to the main menu."
426,"Support advised reinstalling Jetpack, but that's not changed a thing."
427,I'm giving it one last try.
428,I'm not the only one having issues either.
429,There's a few ppl I know who are having problems.
430,No updates fix this.
431,"Samsung Tab 7,0 This review was done after using the app to leave Atlanta airport."
432,"**I do not recommend a buy on this app' but stick with the free version as the  major difference is the ability to search on this one, but it is not good and you essentially have the same features on both, free & Pro, with out it."
433,"MapWithMe Pro has a nice mapping interface it works great on my 7.0, but *The app doesn't do navigation or street address search but merely shows you as a dot on a map which is the same as the free version."
434,*The search feature add to the Pro version is very limited: not worth the money.
435,"* The Samsung 7.0 comes with, Latitude, for free and gives you the ability to download maps for offline uses and work just as good."
436,What I would like to see is point to point navigation and a more in depth search .
437,If you drive into a GPS black out area a offline mapping system is nice to have limited uses to get you back on track.
438,This app used to be great!
439,Now it just crawls!
440,I'm trying to plan a trip with various stops & I can't even get it started.
441,I want to throw my device across the room!
442,Very sorry it has gotten so unusable.
443,EDIT.
444,"Finally the speed picked up, yet it tells me there is no way to get to certain towns where the road is clearly marked and Google Maps has no issue."
445,They take no responsibility for routes not working because they are using some other company's maps.
446,Removed.
447,"ZERO WYSIWYG If you enjoy squinting at your screen while writing in order to distinguish you article's text from HTML code, then you'll love this app."
448,"I must ask: If Evernote & every other goofy little writing app can display bullets, bold, italic, & other formatting as I am writing, why can't this tool for professional writers do the same?"
449,"I enjoy the WordPress writing experience on my PC/browser because I can engage the content & the formatting directly, organically, while I'm creating."
450,"The only time I must face HTML is for the occasional media embed, etc."
451,But with this app the HTML codes are scattered throughout the article & act like irritating little jolts from speed bumps as the appear in the paragraph I'm working on.
452,"So it's impossible to get into a state of ""flow! """
453,"C'mon, developers, you can do better than this."
454,I would gladly pay for a WYSIWYG WordPress writing tool.
455,"Until then, it's back to my PC for writing & editing my blog posts."
456,Decent app.
457,Tried out a few offline nav apps that use osm for data and this had the best looking map display for me.
458,Clean and clear display during navigation a plus.
459,"Suggested nav routes were generally good, but did not care for the inability to ignore toll roads as well as to get more than one suggested route."
460,"The biggest shortcoming for me was that with just about all osm apps, the POI/address search are useless unless those items are entered in the osm database."
461,A suggestion would be to have a online search function (like MapFactor's google search) to be able to find those items and be able to translate the info into an offline nav point.
462,"Another suggestion would be to improve the display functions during navigation, ie: speedometer/speeding warnings, lane assist, and fixed speed cameras."
463,Needs improvements but a solid app overall.
464,Issues Downloading Maps to External Storage I installed the app and for several days have tried to download maps with routing for several US states.
465,I used settings to download the maps to my external SD card.
466,The app shows and says that maps or downloading/downloaded at first.
467,If I exit the app and reenter.
468,only a couple of maps now show as downloaded.
469,Tried to uninstall/install several times and still does not work correctly.
470,More stars when this major feature is working correctly.
471,Update: Giving you three stars due to quick response and concern!
472,See my email to you with the requested info.
473,Let's get this working together!
474,I tried this app over a year ago and I couldn't get it to work with my domain.
475,I decided to try again and this time it worked.
476,I love being able to post at any time without being on my computer.
477,The only issues I'm having are that I have yet to be able to upload a picture.
478,I think this feature is worth one whole star.
479,"I tried uploading a picture on my provider network and over WiFi, neither worked."
480,The other issue I'm having is that I can't seem to check categories for my post.
481,I have to log in through my browser to do that.
482,It may be user error but I couldn't find that option.
483,"All in all, it works for generic text posts - at least for me."
484,I'll take that over NOTHING!
485,Slow and broken for long distance travel.
486,App slows randomly and takes forever to find a path.
487,"When you search for a location and see the name of the place you want to go to, you can't select until it loads all other relevant locations related to the query which wastes around 10 seconds."
488,I'm using a PCT L29 Huawei phone for reference with the whole map downloaded with over 40gb of free space and no other application running.
489,This is a terrible app.
490,Use Google maps instead.
491,It is okay but there are some issues with content being flat out incorrect.
492,I've copied and pasted the given code to observe it's behavior into a text editor and it just kept throwing errors when the lesson insisted that I would get a certain result.
493,Comments are disabled throughout the lessons I take meaning I can't contact them about it.
494,"If the writers of these courses can't give correct syntax, how am I supposed to learn?"
495,Also the built in text editor is glitchy.
496,Absolutely Awful.
497,"As other reviewers have said, the app freezes up whenever I try to insert an image."
498,I have a Samsung Note 10.1 and every attempt has locked my tablet.
499,I attempted an uninstall/reinstall and the same problem occurs.
500,The window also begins cutting off longer posts.
501,"The post is still there, but you will need to use your up/down buttons instead of the scroll function to see it."
502,There is also no menu once you get to the post screen.
503,"Navigation between dashboard, post, and post options is difficult."
504,I have been frustrated by the last several updates to this app.
505,"If you need to only post text, it isn't so bad, hence two stars."
506,"Any posts beyond simple, short text should be done online."
507,Maps.me is usually better than nothing.
508,Route planning is not the best.
509,"I could not drag a route to change it, and the app often refused to plan a route that ran near uninstalled maps."
510,"At one point, the route it chose added about an hour to a six-hour drive."
511,"The triangle icon indicating direction of travel often pointed perpendicular or opposite to the actual direction of travel, or ran alongside the road, or across open fields or bodies of water."
512,"Amusing on the autobahn, but a real pain when driving slowly or walking in a city center or small village."
513,Gives very short notice for lane changes/exits.
514,"And unlike Google Maps which will say ""slight right"" or ""use right lane,"" this app tends to say only ""turn right!"""
515,"Which, again, is confusing."
516,"If you can use it, Google Maps is way better."
517,But this did have the best interface/features of the various OSM-using apps that I looked at.
518,"I'd probably use it again, but only as the last resort."
519,"Edit 03.09.20: After nearly 10 years of using maps.me, I've finally switched to an open-source (GPL) OSM front-end, which has no ads, no forced updates, no commercial tie-ins, gives more control to the end-user (me!"
520,"), and offers a richer useful feature set."
521,"Bye, and thanks for all the fish ..."
522,"As other reviewers have mentioned, you can't search by address."
523,"For example, if your want directions to 12335 Fake St, the app will refuse."
524,It will only let you plot a route to Fake St.
525,"If Fake St is more than a few blocks long, that's a huge problem."
526,"Also, you can't even search for an address until you download that region's maps."
527,"If you want to drive from NYC to LA, you have to download every map along the way before you go."
528,"Problem is, most maps are named after smaller towns, not big cities."
529,Very frustrating.
530,Wanted to start by organizing menu items because an apple user showed me how easy it was.
531,"Android app, I find out, has no option in the app."
532,"After meeting with the other user, we find out I have to go to ""independent publisher 2"" and get redirected to the browser."
533,"There, we find ""menu"" but am unable to open the items I create."
534,Unable to delete items because tapping on the arrow drop down button on the right only works 1/1000 times.
535,Not user friendly.
536,Disappointing app experienc
537,"I need to edit this review, the most valuable feature of the app were the widgets and they simply don't work!!!"
538,The values are not getting any update!!
539,The new today widgets are missing the title of the blog.
540,"This was a nice feature on the old widgets, light and dark themes are not wnought to identify the blogs."
541,"The widget does not keep the size, from time to time I have to expand them."
542,"When clicking on the today widget I expect to go to today, this was the default behaviour of the old widgets."
543,So inaccurate and unreliable!
544,It was the cause of MUCH frustration when walking in Barcelona and Seville.
545,"It seems to perform better in cities laid out on a clear grid but beyond that, it's pretty useless."
546,I absolutely would NOT use this app for driving navigation.
547,"To be specific, the location arrow is very slow to respond and it often indicates the opposite direction of actual travel."
548,"Next, t here seems to be a 'sweet spot' for reading the street signs when zooming in to pinpoint location."
549,Editor is missing not even half the functionality as the one in the web browser.
550,You can't even add a heading or set the font size.
551,The only way to do it is by going to the HTML editor and add a tag that way.
552,"The only good thing about this is being able to manage posts, pages and comments (move or remove them)."
553,"If you want to edit posts or page on your phone or tablet, you're better to do it another one and copy + paste it in using the web browser admin panel."
554,Grateful for this app and love how I can load media from phone direct to gallery.
555,(pls allow access to the WP image gallery from the desktop version).
556,Also Widget on stats is great.
557,-Wish writing functionality was better.
558,And on few occasions the App version threw off main version from Laptop.
559,I had to rebuild post for hour.
560,"(even now I see ""version conflict"" pls make way to disable)."
561,"-Also ability to change appearance, widgets eg text, etc., would be great."
562,Then a 4+5stars!
563,Thanks WP Team.
564,Blacklisted me?
565,"I tried logging into my WP site, once, using this app while on my home wifi but it couldn't connect."
566,"Now my home network is not allowed to load the page at all, from any browser from any device."
567,The server doesn't respond to my IPs request to view the page.
568,I can only load the site using other networks so I have to go to a friend's place or public wifi.
569,I tried using the app to log on using my mobile data and now my mobile IP is blocked too.
570,Very troublesome.
571,I've contacted support.
572,GPS not working without Internet!!!
573,"yepp, the gps only works when i get online otherwise it gets stuck at the last position where i came online usually wi-fi..so no gps while offline!!"
574,big turndown😑😒 otherwise maps are good... improve it n I will increase the rating...
575,"I m using Mi4 with version 4.4 android.. n 1 more thing add a feature of planning a route between any two points on the map like by selecting them on the map not  by searching,  like Google has.."
576,This latest version no longer lets me share an article from a web browser into a new post.
577,"It always gives me a blank post where, before, it set the post title to the article title and placed a link to the article in the body of the post."
578,This app is pretty useless to me until it's fixed.
579,Gets worse.
580,"Bloated, huge map files suddenly  etc Before you could download maps without the navigation."
581,I love having a lot of maps of countries I'm not traveling to.
582,"Same also for the traffic info, hotel bookings etc."
583,I paid then for the pro version and I get trash.
584,Pity as it used to be perfect!
585,Now it gets stuck often is slow and buggy.
586,Apart from it there is a persistent bug with search.
587,I search a place and I get a point that I bookmarked before in the area instead of what I'm looking for.
588,After a few tries suddenly it may give me the real place.
589,The update buried the feature I use most in the app This app was great until the last update.
590,The part of the app that I used the most was the admin page access.
591,It was always the first thing I looked at whenever I opened up the app.
592,"I maintain several WP sites for myself, both business and personal."
593,I use the app for when I don't want or have time to sit down at my pc to do updates.
594,Where I thought the app shined was maintaining my WP sites.
595,The app allowed me to be able to easily cycle through all my sites quickly to see if they needed plugin or WP updates.
596,"After selecting the admin option, I could click each site and within minutes have all the sites updated, significantly quicker than using a pc to do it."
597,"With the latest update to the app, the developers buried the admin page access 3 clicks deep, so what would take me 1 click + a click per site to check update status, now requires me to click into the settings, then 2 clicks per site to check for update status."
598,I considered this app a 5 star app before this bizarre change.
599,I'm hoping it was an oversite or test on the developers part and that they'll fix this in the next update.
600,"Otherwise, at least in my opinion, they've partially crippled the app."
601,"App only for big cities like london, delhi etc."
602,Mostly lines only available without name.
603,"Shown Only one navigation route, though many alternate available."
604,Pros 1.
605,Less data and less battery usage 2.
606,Big cites data available 3.
607,"Make our own bookmarks, location etc Cons."
608,1.
609,Complete map data available only for large cites.
610,2.
611,"Suburban, minor cites name only included If your moblie has enough space, google offline is better."
612,Not suitable for travellers through small cities villages etc.
613,Formatting is lost each time I exit post view after editing.
614,Upon returning  to the post it appears as one solid block of text with all styling removed.
615,Issues with Grammarly's inline word correction appearing as a question mark  icon in the WordPress Mobile post editor.
616,Update: The formatting problem  occurs when using the Gutenberg editor on a computer then editing the same  post on mobile.
617,It seems the content blocks don't translate well to the  mobile editor
618,"For an official app of one of the most popular blogging platform on the internet, it's not very friendly or responsive to changes on the web version."
619,"One, none of my pictures could be uploaded to the media, and two, deleted websites still remained in the list until I finally figured out how to remove them, yet it didn't do it cleanly."
620,"Never changed for years, probably will uninstall finally."
621,Hated it!
622,This used to be a really nice app until I got the latest update.
623,"It's slow, loads very few posts on the reader and when it hangs while I'm using it, other people can't access my site!"
624,I simply hate and I advice you not to update your app if your still using the old version.
625,.
626,.
627,"Oh, and another thing, you can't view all your followers and the stats area is just complicated and useless."
628,They have also removed the widgets area
629,"Fine for pedestrians, problematic for driving."
630,"i've used this to get around by foot several times, with no notable problems except that it continually resets ""north is up"" view every time the screen turns on (which agitates me to no end)."
631,"While driving, though, its voice volume is too low to hear above ambient background noise (GMaps has an extra voice volume booster for this), it almost invariably waits until a navigation point is directly beside you before telling you about it (""turn left... behind you""), and it often picks a far-out-of-the-way route when a straight line would work just fine."
632,i used this on my last trip by car and it ended up costing me an additional 25%+ driving distance because of voice delays and truly curious navigation choices.
633,The only strong argument in favor of this app over gmaps is its ability to be used  completely offline.
634,Frustrated that Google Maps only shows restaurants nearby.
635,This appears to have the same distance limit in restaurant searches- it only shows restaurants as far out as a mile or so.
636,There was also a text box advertising it's subscription service that loaded on open.
637,Google maps has offline maps and a Share feature.
638,"This is, as far as I can tell, the exact same material I get using the free app that I wanted this to replace."
639,"Doesn't search by postcode, the three locations I tried came up with no  results (the locations have been there for over 20 years), then when you  search for the actual road names and find them, the area it lists them in  is usually wrong, so you'd have to really know where you were heading  before you trusted it."
640,"The app also seems to only give you one route  choice, no option to change to quickest or shortest in the settings, or  avoid motorways etc."
641,Can't really comment on much else as I gave up after  learning those things.
642,"All in all it's basic, the navigation is competent  but very sensitive to kinks in a road (so be prepared to bear left / right  a lot when you're just following a road)."
643,"My advice is to use Navmii which  isn't perfect, but light years ahead of this."
644,"First, you should be able to enable all POIs along your route."
645,It would be really helpful to see gas stations or restaurants without having to search for them.
646,MapPoint has this feature and it works well.
647,"Second, is night mode."
648,It saves power and is easier on the eyes.
649,"Third, is a navigation view instead of the typical overhead view."
650,And forth is voice guided navigation.
651,"The map files seem to be large too (compared to other offline mapping apps), any way you can make them smaller?"
652,Change their business model to a subscription.
653,I purchased this app for all my devices Android and iOS.
654,"At the time there where no additional fees, ads or subscriptions."
655,Now this app has ads and to get rid of them you have to pay a monthly subscription.
656,"They changed the rules in the middle of the game, I'm deleting it from all my devices."
657,This app works offline after you download maps.
658,Searching for an address is not good.
659,"You can import KMZ files, such as places you've mark in Goolge Maps."
660,Disappointing The big plus is the offline use of maps and the maps that look good.
661,On the downside: we disagree on the fastest route.
662,On first use it misses a connection to a highway and suggesting a longer route.
663,"Then the app even tries to send me back three times unnecessary, making the journey even longer."
664,Vocal directions are ambiguous compared to my regular Garmin nav and compared to Google.
665,Maybe it's just the dutch language.
666,At times the GPS update seems out of sync with the actual location.
667,Good as a backup nav.
668,I use the app for offline map viewing.
669,"When trying to plot a route, I couldn't untill updating the maps."
670,"This shouldn't be the case, and very annoying if you're abroad and roaming."
671,"If you can add a button 'use existing maps' next to 'download' and 'cancel', I'll give the 4 star I think you could be"
672,Lacking options When adding an image to a post I cant set alt text or remove the link off the pic... this app is pathetic.
673,It has so much potential yet too little effort has been made :( can't even view the html editor to remove the link and change alt text.
674,This forces me to use the full site which has a very poor mobile interface... To the guy bellow defending this app: I am so sorry your site is so basic and your SEO so poor that this app is acceptable by your apparently low standards.
675,"Expecially after the updates of the last months, the app shows issues that make it not usable:  -it cannot make a path on a map not updated (and if you are abroad without Internet and unlucky enough to miss the update, you cannot use the app, which denies the usefulness of it); -you cannot zoom on the rough map if you do not download the detailed map first, so you cannot get an idea of zones you did not download (not even the zones that are clearly visible on the rough map when not zooming); -full of pop-ups and messages you cannot remove, covering the map and being extremely annoyng; -the ""search"" option is horrible, sometimes cannot find even extremely famous places (try searching ""San Marco"" in Venice...)."
676,"Nice update but... Love the look of last update and the new menu but comments are no longer loading, evGalaxy ery time I try to refresh the notifications I get a message  ""comments could not be refreshed at this time."""
677,And when I insert images into a post they just disappear before I have chance to save the post and I have the start uploading them again.
678,Can't change Offline Map Location (Phone Memory to Sd Card)  How can I move maps to SD?
679,"(for Android devices)     If you want to store downloaded maps on SD, you should move them directly from the app �?open app’s settings > Map > Maps storage > select SD card."
680,"If you don’t see Maps storage tab in app’s settings, turn off the device, take out SD card and put it back again, turn on the device."
681,"If you moved the app itself to SD, move it back to the device storage."
682,this app is an absolute rubbish.
683,the new update is real catastrophe.
684,the settings go back to default each time and the app loses the address for map storage files which results in asking to download the map data again.
685,i had bookmarked the location of my hotel but then when i was in Spain it failed show me even the downloaded maps.
686,just rubbish.
687,"Block editor is VERY slow to load, and it's a nightmare for text created elsewhere."
688,"List block turns into text block after pasting lines of text, and it can't be changed or adjusted."
689,Underscore text option is missing.
690,App lags when adding blocks.
691,"Formatting in classic editor is now wonky, especially for lists."
692,Block Editor seemed alright.
693,"But user has very LIMITED options over control on what text's font, colors, style, and types of separator, line spacing setting, and inability to implement line breaks in 1 paragraph block without starting a new block which is on another separate line spacing."
694,It still has an issue with merging the given format from Classic Editor and comes up with Error Block when User fix the broken paragraphs caused by Block Editor's uses.
695,WordPress going backwards Wordpress has taken an app that has been steadily improving and removed the ability to verify links while writing or editing posts.
696,No longer useful and will be headed back to a browser.
697,Very disappointed with version 5.6.
698,"- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -Response to WordPress Support: When I first noticed the change to the ability to use links within the editor section of the app, I contacted support."
699,The change was confirmed and I was told that links will no longer function.
700,Hence one star rating.
701,Even though I tried this with different keyboards it's editing capabilies are poor.
702,They don't come up to any of the external editors that I have on my tablet.
703,Compared to the pc/web version this is crippled.
704,"One reason I would like an external editor is that I have a lot more formatting capability and the ability to 'snapshot' or, for example, undo deletions."
705,"rather than sweat coding more editor functions, simply flipping into an more capable external editor seems sensible."
706,There are a lot of management features in the PC/web version that I consider very basic.
707,being able to edit the raw HTML code to correct errors or carry out formatting that the 'visual' mode doesn't permit is one.
708,"Again, this might be resolved with an external editor: edit in visual/text or in html switch."
709,Perhaps the simplest demonstration of what's lacking is to run the tablet and the PC/web version side by side.
710,"I realize there is a screen real estate issue, especially when trying to run this on a 4.5 inch phone, but perhaps that's a case of ""you shouldn't be doing that""."
711,However other applications I use do have panels that pull down or pull in from the side.
712,... out of space ...
713,Major issue:  Night mode setting on Galaxy S10 does not trigger automatic night mode.
714,"""Always On"" nor ""Automatically"" in developer settings does not turn on dark mode, but it does in all other Google apps that support the Android 9 night mode."
715,"The only apps from Google to have issues with this is I/O 2019, the newest update to Google Contacts (it worked prior to latest update), and the new update to Google Calculator."
716,"Google Play Games is the best version of dark mode implemented - it respects A) Battery Saver, B) Night mode (auto or manual), and C) colors the navigation bar the same color as the theme."
717,The backcountry road maps are pretty accurate for wheelie in the bush couldn't get it to actually work for directions in town or route plan with it.
718,Just getting it again on my new phone.
719,I did manage to get routes to load.
720,"However the search option doesn't find nearby places (addresses) and nearby parks,towns etc easily."
721,Also I can not seem to alter the route.
722,For example I put in directions to Sloquet hot springs.
723,The route the app selected is a very rough road compared to the parralel road that also gets you there.
724,It would be nice to select other roads with the touch of a finger.
725,Please improve and get back to me.
726,Thanks for the prompt response on my last review
727,Introduces one to a world of interesting people.
728,I like the app but wonder sometimes why WordPress suggests that I share posts on social media to increase views when I have done so to several sites the day before and had multiple comments and likes on those sites but WP shows me having less than one-third as many views or worse.
729,People follow my blog or like a specific post but somehow there are no views that day.
730,The notifications are useful but sometimes seem inaccurate.
731,Address search I had no trouble  understanding the instructions for entering an address search.
732,Because I never found any such instructions.
733,The developer's quick reply to those 2 sentences was simple but ineffective.
734,"""Enter the country name"" etc etc?"
735,"Ah, they redefined the problem!"
736,Enter the info where?
737,"The search icon opens a drop down list, but does not appear to open a blank to enter anything."
738,Wait!
739,Wait!
740,One can click on what looks like the list's title bar and type in an address?
741,Why not say that in the first place?
742,OK now we're getting some place.
743,"Good app but why can't I select my starting point, It always take the the starting point as the current location."
744,There should be an option to select my starting location of my choice.
745,"And lot of  places are missing , not really reliable like Google map."
746,Offline line good after dropping a pin at a place after getting the location from Google map.
747,Ui needs to be improved.
748,"""Setting"" closes after twice back press."
749,Meh...
750,I ended up using Google Map for the whole trip Search results are terrible.
751,I keep getting many churches for POI or street names instead of the actual places.
752,It couldn't find state parks or national parks visitor centers.
753,Can't see all the search results on the map.
754,Can't input address.
755,"And there's no direction to the place, which makes the app even more useless."
756,Terrible image management This app is flat awful and unusable for a blog with images.
757,First you have to insert a photo into a post to get it into your media library.
758,Then you have to select the same photo to be the featured image.
759,BUT then the post will show the SAME photo twice!
760,So you have to delete the photo from the post and leave it as the featured image for the post to look normal and not retarded.
761,Would be a million times better if you could select a featured image from local library
762,App stops working on my android head unit (px5) after the latest update.
763,The app is not opening on my andorid head unit (px5 MODEL).
764,It just showing black screen.
765,I already tried to unsinstall and reinstalled it but still the same.
766,I also clear cache and clear data but it did not help.
767,It is not loading only black screen when I try to open.
768,After that it shows error to send report to developers.
769,Big issue.
770,I have this big issue that Is very poor of this app...
771,I was driving and it took me through footpath though on car and I got stuck on the way and had to leave my car and continue on foot since I didn't have any other option...
772,I suggest you integrate Google maps in this app because it can't find some locations like my church.
773,I had to use Google maps and bookmark it in this app before I couldn't get lost anymore but the other problem is it deleted the bookmark without my permission..
774,I installed this app in the hope of avoiding google maps.
775,In favour: map quality is excellent.
776,"Bookmarking places isn't very intuitive, but the real failure is lack of routing understanding."
777,In the UK an app like this should have settings that create *sensible* route choices; nothing I found stopped it trying to send me from Wiltshire to Kent via central London.
778,On paper the route looks ok; in the real world it involves a congestion charge and would take forever (subjectively).
779,More work needed.
780,It's okay.
781,I'm not a big fan of this app overall.
782,"The layout on my tablet leaves a lot of negative unused space, if you put the options icons on the left and had a view of your feed/blog on the right it would greatly improve upon that."
783,"I do not like how you can not preview or view any blog, I think its a bit absurd that I have to use my browser to actually see my blogs."
784,"I also noticed you can not add/create a new blog on the app, I would have to do this in the browser as well and reload my account into this app for the new blog to appear in the drop down."
785,"Over all the app is visually appealing, quick and operates effeciently on my tablet, but the missing features completely deture me from keeping this app when I can probably find a compatible blogging app that suits my needs more."
786,Or just use my browser.
787,"I'll check back later and redownload if improvements are made, I am a fan of wordpress but this app is nearly useless as is."
788,"Unintuitive I was using this app to walk around Munich, but it was often difficult-to-impossible to see the name of the street I was on."
789,"I wanted to use it offline and without using my location (to save battery), but the app constantly prompted me to switch on location."
790,"There's a bug in the bookmark view, it's difficult to edit the bookmark for items with a lot of details, it will snap to the bottom or top, and the ""edit"" button is in the middle."
791,"Also, navigating the app in general is unintuitive."
792,"In my opinion, there is no search feature and the Discover section does not quickly adapt to my interests."
793,What a terrible app!
794,"I understand that it might be meant to be used in conjunction with the website, but that model is irrelevant in today's smartphone-driven world."
795,"I don't know who clapped each other on the back in the back office for creating this app, because once again, in my opinion it is terrible and they should get some BA's on the job quickly!"
796,"This latest version changed my default map location from SD card to main memory, then told me I didn't have enough memory to update my maps, although this version only updates changes."
797,"I then had to download my maps again after changing the location, as it STILL doesn't recognise that I already have downloaded maps!"
798,Just to add that I have used maps from my sdcard correctly for a few years now!
799,This rating only applies to the latest version which screwed up my configuration.
800,"This forced me to re download maps that are already on my sdcard, as even after changing the location back to the sdcard, the app still didn't check for the existent of valid maps in the selected location."
801,It's mostly OK.
802,This cannot fully replace the web dashboard.
803,But I think it is OK as a mobile companion app.
804,"You can do all basic tasks, like managing your blogs, notifications, comments, etc."
805,with this app.
806,I just wish it could upload multiple media files.
807,A separate html mode in post editor would be very great.
808,It also has upload problems from time to time.
809,Would be great if those can be added/fixed :-)
810,I have published a blog post one week ago on my computer and today I  decided to start writing a new post on the mobile app.
811,I suddenly saw the  blog post that I have already published and shared it on all the social  media accounts in the draft section.
812,I was confused so I clicked on it.
813,"When I clicked on it the draft from one month ago opened, the post without  any pictures and half of the text missing."
814,"I thought that it was super  weird so I checked it also on the computer and the original post that was  already published was gone, I could only found the draft."
815,My heart stopped  and everything was lost.
816,Thank god that the whole article was posted to my  email when it was published so I could just copy paste everything.
817,The app  is not refreshing and updating the posts that are already published so I  will not use it anymore.
818,"Navigation is available only from your current location, you cant set another starting point for a route there is - NO route options for a route - like in google maps."
819,"I found one app which has this and offline maps and for moment is free which i recommend after I have spent a afternoon with install and test of famous and good rated apps like Telnav, ex Skobler, Sygic, GPS Navigation from Bzing s.r.o."
820,ex.
821,Be-on road which miss basic function like the one mentioned before
822,Good but missing Custom Post Type support.
823,I add CPTs into most of my sites and only being able to update blog entries is very limiting.
824,Image handling is a bit buggy.
825,Really good when fixing typos or creating quick posts.
826,The earlier versions of this app were way more functional.
827,I've been using Maps.me for about a month now as a backup to my Garmin as I travel around Europe.
828,It does a decent job of helping you navigate around city's.
829,However it is borderline useless when navigating great distances.
830,It only offers one route and it is always the most direct route.
831,That means if the most direct route is through the center of a massive city as supposed to using a ring road.
832,It's taking you through the city.
833,This has happened to me a few times while using maps.me and since I don't know the area it's bitten me in the ass almost everytime.
834,Something that would take 30min using the ring roads instead takes 2hrs because you have to go through the whole city.
835,It also has a very hard time rerouting.
836,"Several times I followed the road signs instead of the app and it refused to reroute, it didn't even reroute a turn around."
837,It just kept spinning the map in circles.
838,"Like I said for city nav it's not bad, Google maps is better but this is a decent no data options."
839,But for long drives I'd avoid this app.
840,Clunky I have no idea how this has a 4.6 star rating.
841,There's no importing of favorite places.
842,Very unintuitive to set your favorites like home and work.
843,Not user friendly to navigate to your favorites.
844,The voice is very unnatural sounding.
845,Turn directions do not include street name that you're turning onto.
846,"Distances read out in feet instead of miles (""turn left in 3000 feet"" vs. 1/2 mile)."
847,"Finally, it's worse than Google maps about unnecessarily telling you to keep left to stay on the interstate at off ramps."
848,The app could use some work.
849,"It's great for when I'm away from my laptop, but some customization features aren't present in the mobile app and there's a formatting glitch that makes posting difficult."
850,"I cannot customize my message, write an excerpt, or customize my slug when on the mobile app."
851,I'd love it if I could.
852,The formatting glitch happens every time I have to go back in my writing and add or delete sentences.
853,It will change all previous text to headings.
854,Pretty great otherwise.
855,The app regularly crashes as I type.
856,It freezes and grinds to a crawl just as often.
857,The app fails to recognize letters as I type them and it deletes spaces after words.
858,A solution is to work in html mode.
859,It appears that these bugs are only an issue when you have images display while editing a post.
860,"The more images, the worse the problem."
861,"It seems unbelievable that WordPress, with its QA resources, can't fix these issues."
862,Pixel 2 (Stock Android) Feb/2019: Looks promising but app rarely works properly.
863,"Even while traveling abroad, Google Maps Offline worked great but MAPS.ME Offline did not work at all - couldn't even find my location, let alone use navigation."
864,"You may have a different experience than I did but I cannot rely on it, and hence, will not recommend it."
865,Hope they fix the issues.
866,Technically Very Bad!
867,"I love osm, but this app far from good."
868,"Slow rendering of maps, poor info and bad navigation of pois, but most importantly it drains ur device battery!!!"
869,Even if in the background  have it uses 40-50% CPU heated up to 77 degC:  130|root@jfltexx:/ # top | grep map                                             25348  1  48% S    34 956836K  66984K  bg u0_a276  com.mapswithme.maps.pro 25348  1  45% S    34 956836K  66984K  bg u0_a276  com.mapswithme.maps.pro 25348  1  43% S    34 956836K  66984K  bg u0_a276  com.mapswithme.maps.pro 25348  1  41% S    34 956836K  66984K  bg u0_a276  com.mapswithme.maps.pro 25348  1  44% S    34 956836K  66984K  bg u0_a276  com.mapswithme.maps.pro 25348  1  48% S      I didnt say its the location as i didnt debug it just saw it uses CPU a lot as you can see.
870,"I did nothing but do a search and view points on the map, then press home button."
871,I'm sure you can reproduce it.
872,Could have been better Purchase the Pro version because sometimes internet/Google Maps is not always accessible.
873,"The maps looks good at first glance, especially it has street number in the map."
874,The most unbearable problem so far is the poor searching function: tried to find a certain address but the map can not actively find the exact location and re-center the map to the target location.
875,"Moreover, it seems that the app does not recognize the address at all and do nothing."
876,If you can not even search an address then this maps in a sense is crippled.
877,"My cell phone is LG G3, Android 4.4.2, had already loaded with the maps used for address searching."
878,One of the most problematic and difficult apps on my device....
879,"This is even more unfortunate, since millions of users out there trust and use worpress - while this weak app is the only real smartpgone tool available to access your site."
880,"After logging in relatively quick and smoothly, things start by looking promising."
881,"But as soon as you start to try publishing or sharing media, the app starts bombarding error messages."
882,I have already contacted support and forum - without an answer....
883,"Excellent offline access, mediocre travel tool It's really nice not to have to have a WiFi connection to access detailed maps."
884,"You can download just the areas you need to your internal or external storage and always have access (the KitKat external SD ""sandbox"" is supported)."
885,The map will follow your position if you have location enabled.
886,"One serious flaw is the inability to interpret address info being sent from other applications, so you can't use this application as your default map."
887,"Links from calendar, e-mail, and browser apps will just go to the middle of the ocean near Africa at Lat/Lon 0/0)."
888,Another issue is cross-map routing: you can't plan a route across state or country boundaries that cross map files.
889,"Uber detailed maps, search needs tinkering By far the most detailed mapping, right down to stores, plazas, schools, even addresses along main roads."
890,"That said, the search and location save features need some work."
891,"Even saved locations wouldn't show on search, whereas HERE pops it up as soon as a similarity is detected, along with nearby options for food and services - and saving and renaming was a bit awkward."
892,A cleaner color scheme choice would be awesome.
893,The yellow tint in this map is awful with a screen filter.
894,"I want to ""add a place/name it"" with an ADDRESS Not freaking pinpoint, how I'm I suppose to do that, especially since I don't know the place?!!"
895,"Once I added it, my goal is to bookmark it."
896,Help me Maps Me.
897,"While we're at it, can't you guys like just transfer all the google named/tagged locations to your app (ok... Maybe this is pretty hard)?"
898,Somewhat working Route planning not working.
899,Have s6 edge.
900,Map loads.
901,Downloaded map with routing info.
902,But does not pick up my location.
903,".. keeps saying enable location, which is."
904,Search results shows restaurants and Kms from me.
905,But when I try to route.
906,Keeps popping up with enable location
907,A little disappointed Was planning to use the apps for navigation in Osaka Japan.
908,Paid for the pro function so that I can search for places.
909,"However, I realized the map is mostly in Japanese (unlike Google Map)."
910,The hotels that I've booked cannot be found using the search function.
911,I supposed you would need to enter the hotel name in Japanese in order for the search to work.
912,Google map works wonder using English.
913,I wonder if I can get a refund.
914,"Even without using the search function, the Osaka map is difficult to read (compared to Google Map) as it is mostly in Japanese."
915,"Layout issues Good app to write the body of text, article heading, tags, category and excerpt."
916,"However, I cannot puck a featured image, change the slug, add a meta description and other important features."
917,Stop upgrading pointless design features and upgrade the interface for less pricey smart phones.
918,"I loved the app, but now it deleted my article I use the app frequently to write while I am traveling."
919,I just spent an hour to compose an article.
920,I needed to check a link on chrome and went back to the main menu.
921,It said local draft saved.
922,I looked up what I needed and went back into the app.
923,"In the preview the pictures have been scrambled with the text, an issue I had observed already, which I did not really care about that much."
924,"When I tried to edit it, there was no more content, everything gone except for the heading."
925,Everything was deleted.
926,I purchased maps.me when it wasn't free and now this app wants me to pay for removing ads from ads-free app which I already purchased.
927,"Google, can you please ban this developer?"
928,RE: It's up to you how you spend money which you received for my purchase.
929,It was not 4-year subscription.
930,It was a lifetime purchase.
931,"I do understand you are doing fraud here - sell application to make it add-free, then make it free and return adds back to get money from advertisers after you got money from customers which wanted to remove adds."
932,I'm going to report to Google about this issue and ask for a refund at least.
933,It used to be a good simple app.
934,But I switched to Offline Maps &  Navigation.
935,Because it works much more smoothly and does not have those  unnecessary nearby features etc.
936,and focuse on navigation.
937,"Most  importantly, it can start 3D view by default."
938,So I am not stuck with an  ugly 2D view when not navigating.
939,"When I asked MAPS.ME to allow 3D without  route, they told me it would make the app complicated for users."
940,Then they  added a pile of useless features.
941,I think MAPS.ME doesn't really understand  their users.
942,"Very unstable on Asus Tablet Adding photos via the camera very often crashes the app, which then of course loses everything you've written."
943,If you want to use it I suggest saving every sentence unless you really enjoy retyping.
944,"Annoyingly this also closes the post, so you have to constantly go back into edit mode."
945,Thank goodness I have the keyboard dock.
946,"Also, adding photos does work, and it lets you set alignment, but it doesn't seem to be able to properly type text to flow around those images, so using Alignment None is really the only option."
947,Only useful if you do the most rudimentary tasks.
948,"On my first test, I ended  up giving up and just logging directly into Wordpress Admin via a web  browser."
949,"Photo uploads fail 50% of the time, and the message ""generic  error"" is a useless for troubleshooting."
950,"Worse, the app is so basic you  can't access all of your post settings."
951,Very disappointing.
952,App is good and some issues are there in allowing comment option in new posts.
953,"When we publish a new post, comment option for readers is always hidden."
954,And delete option is too fast.
955,No extra confirmation or any recovery folder for comments & posts available.
956,It hates & really annoying.
957,By mistakes we may delete comments or posts easily.
958,Thats not fair.
959,Wordpress team has to sort it out by a new update.
960,"In general is a good app, but there are some issues."
961,"From the phone, if you have older posts, you can't switch to the editor block."
962,With the phone app you don't have the same options in the editor block as with a PC.
963,"So, if you edit an older post on the phone you have to go to the computer to add that specific element."
964,"But even here there is a problem, because the PC app most of the time doesn't ""see"" the edit you've made on the phone, until you publish it and you can even lose the entire post."
965,Are you kidding me !?
966,"Tbh the app looks great ... Alot of options , nice UI ..."
967,"But the problem is  , "" I can't upload any posts to my wordpress site with this app "" .... Gosh !!!!"
968,U guys kidding me ?
969,"When I try to post something it shows ""Uploading "" for around 50 seconds and after that it always shows. """
970,"post upload failed : An error occured while uploading the post ""  Even if the post contain just a heading and 3 lines of content ( no media files ) the result is same."
971,"For gods sake , plz fix this bug ASAP."
972,"Add images severely broken It tries to load every single photo on the phone, but barely displays thumbnails for any of them, making the app useless."
973,"Need a way to select between photos and downloaded reference photos, otherwise it'll take forever even if the thumbnails worked."
974,"Very disappointed with this update, I'll be using the web browser to post until this broken app is fixed."
975,"Good for offline maps but needs some improvement Search function could be improved, for example pick up foreign letter variations with English letters (e.g."
976,"searching ""mom"" should pick up ""möm""), search in general isn't as ""smart"" as Google maps (if I'm looking for ""cat"" it will list ""catfish"" ""catfishtail"" etc and be hard to find ""cat"", bus/train stations should show up first in searches, etc) which always finds what I'm looking for and has English names of places."
977,And please stop asking me to turn on location services.
978,EDITED- SOMETHING IS WRONG.
979,"POSTS ARE NOT POSTING, PICTURES ARE NOT UPLOADING, PEOPLE ARE NOT ABLE TO VIEW POSTS."
980,PLEASE FIX.
981,Wonderful.
982,I like the upgraded version of this app.
983,I've used WordPress for years but your new step forward is amazing.
984,Just a little request though.
985,PLEASE ADD 'SHARE' OPTION IN SITE PAGES SO THAT WE COULD SHARE LINKS OF OUR INDIVIDUAL SITE PAGES FROM THE APP FOR THOSE OF US MANAGING MULTIPLE PAGES IN ONE WEBSITE.
986,THANKS.
987,"It's a good app overall, but it's seriously buggy."
988,"There are several issues with it, such as not getting notified about things a majority of the time, and refreshing the page just to view your updated post, doesn't help at all!"
989,"Because, either it shows you the old version, or it doesn't update at all."
990,"The positive thing about this, is that the stats and the editor are good."
991,"Please fix these issues, because we all need it"
992,Update April 2017: Should have updated this review much earlier!
993,All my criticisms appear to have been sorted.
994,Now my 2nd choice of navigation app (1st choice is factory installed car unit).
995,Very much improved - use it frequently.
996,Ignore the following!
997,"Laggy, search either not working or finding multiple useless results."
998,Map downloads taking much longer than previously.
999,I'm very disappointed that a once excellent mapping and routing app is now apparently ruined.
1000,Address format I'm testing out the app and the first address I'm trying to navigate to won't show up.
1001,I'm typing in something similar to this.
1002,3211 E 8th Ave or 3211 East 8th Ave and nothing shows up.
1003,When I type that in Google there is no problem finding the place.
1004,Any help would be appreciated.
1005,I  downloaded all the maps for the province I live in.
1006,Map downloading is a nightmare.
1007,"Incredibly slow and clunky, updates are even worse because instead of replacing the old maps it downloads to a new file, taking double the space."
1008,App in general is very slow and nonintuitive.
1009,"Nags for location spy mode (sorry, ""high accuracy"" mode is much less accurate than ""device only"", it just lets Google more comprehensively compromise your privacy)."
1010,Long posters beware I use this app to blog while traveling.
1011,"I have had simple posts (just text and photos) upload as blank SO many times, which I finally realized is when I have too many photos (now I try to cap at 10 or 15)."
1012,"No indication that something is wrong, just waiting 30+ minutes for an upload, then finding out that it is blank."
1013,"No usable draft, no way to get the content back other than to start over."
1014,So incredibly frustrating.
1015,"Also, formatting is off when I try to edit on a desktop when I've saved a draft from app."
1016,"As a cyclist I have to say that this is the only app so far that I have checked that allows you to create routes using small roads that doesn't crash or fails for some random reason or has them all removed; google maps, strava, osmand, bike citizen, here we go, sygic maps, all of them failed spectacularly, this one did not."
1017,"However the real problem is that I am unable to create anything but short routes due to the limitations in the amount of stops that I can add; given there are tons of forest roads you can never pick the one you like and make something longer than 30km of a route; It also isn't even a paid feature, I'd have paid for such feature in a heartbeat."
1018,"Two fixes, having 3 stops is ok if I can chain routes, as in save them and load them quickly; or allowing to add up to 10+ stops, the average that you need on 80+km rides on these forest mazes."
1019,"Back to square one having to buy a GPS, and these garmins aren't cheap at all; I am however pleased on how close this was to actually work, that I dared to write this review; hoping they implement it, even if it's paid; maybe they can have competition in something they never expected to."
1020,App can't open posts written with classic blocks.
1021,Posts still being set to a backdate by default (I can literally reproduce this behavior with EVERY SINGLE POST).
1022,No functionality for duplicate title slug detection.
1023,"This literally gets worse with every ""update""."
1024,I miss the days where I could just use this app and it did what it was supposed to.
1025,One of the most consistently unreliable apps I've ever used.
1026,"Countless bugs and glitches : copy/paste, erasing parts of unselected text when underlining other parts above, captions disappearing and becoming regular text, creating decorated texts from nowhere when copying from a txt."
1027,"editor, editor is so laggy when text is above 4500 characters with pictures..."
1028,I end up spending a lot of time correcting my text instead of writing it !
1029,"New block editor is even worse and you're forced to use it, difficult to switch it off."
1030,"(Samsung SG8 updated, Gboard up)"
1031,"Kept erasing sessions App kept erasing my schedule, including events in the past."
1032,"This prevented me from rating sessions attended since they closed that time slot after it passed, as well as forcing me to resort to screenshots for each hour block."
1033,"Erasing seemed most frequent when rotating device, but still did it with rotation lock on."
1034,It sucks.
1035,Doesn't read GPX files and has sent me to nonexistent roads.
1036,UPDATE after developer's answer: Are you nuts?
1037,"Every other navigation application directly supports reading GPX files, which have became a de facto standard!"
1038,"If you don't and also do not have plans to support them in the future, I will uninstall the app and unrecommend it to everybody else!"
1039,Who wants to be dependent on an online GPX=>KML conversion web page in the middle of a desert?!
1040,"UPDATE 2: Even Google Earth supports opening GPX files, as it does some magic of importing the files ot its own KML format when trying to open a GPX file on it."
1041,UPDATE 3.
1042,Why the hell the red circle with a number one on the icon?!
1043,"I am always thinking I have a notification, I open the app and there is nothing new inside!!"
1044,!
1045,Was able to connect to my personally hosted blog.
1046,"Everything looks pretty good, but the Featured Image setting doesn't work."
1047,"I add an image from my Media Library, then edit its properties...Check the box for ""Featured Image"" and then leave the box for ""Show in post"" unchecked, but it always just shows the image in the post and refuses to set it as the Featured image, no matter how many times I go back and try to edit it/redo it."
1048,"Unfortunately, that was the main function I was hoping to use, so pretty worthless to me."
1049,"Block Editor is consistent with text format, but 2 much white spaces between 2 paragraphs need to shrink at 1.5 or 1.0."
1050,Does not have Sticky Post option for published posts unlike Web version.
1051,"Is there a way to balance the font size and format of paragraph without the texts going off at random italic and random font size there and here, especially between web version and mobile?"
1052,"Options for font size, font style, line-spacing control are must-needs regardless of app or internet versions."
1053,It used to be good and still is for basics but: 1) offline navigation instruction completely wrong.
1054,The voice says to go straight but instead you need to exit the motorway on the right.
1055,2) rerouting takes too long time most of the times.
1056,The navigator keeps on following the route it expected despite the road I took is wrong (for the above mentioned reason).
1057,"3) expected time of arrival... the calculator is really negative at the beginning but optimistic after a few km... if I plan a 200km road, the first time indication is about 4hrs (or anyway higher than any reasonably possible time)."
1058,"After 100 or 120km, despite I'm still missing 80km road, the expected time of arrival drops to 1 minute."
1059,Driving with your app has become hard!
1060,Good app but terrible at finding streets.
1061,"I live in Mexico city and every time I write the name of a street, it appears more than 20 streets with that name because it searches even in other states."
1062,I uninstalled most of the country maps and left only my city but the results from other states continue to appear.
1063,"So, to click the correct street is a pain."
1064,It should search only in the city you are at.
1065,"If it had google's map search engine like, this would be definitely the best offline app for maps."
1066,And it is not possible to add a city name with the street you are searching.
1067,"As soon as you start typing more letters all the results disappear and a weeping dog appear saying ""no results""."
1068,And also if I am using an app like this is because I don't know where the street I want to go is.
1069,"Even if I move the map or zoom in or out, I am lost trying to figure it out where the direction I want is."
1070,"Really enjoy building my travel blogs, other friends use it too."
1071,Easy to use and set up.
1072,Update - unfortunately have fallen out of love with this app.
1073,"When your posts get to a certain size, the app just slows down and becomes too laborious to edit."
1074,Ive tried on my tablet and phone and it's the same.
1075,Asked for help but they can't seem to solve.
1076,Tested each time it updates but still the same issue.
1077,No more than ok I tried this application offline before going on a trip abroad (did not actually navigate with it).
1078,Seems ok for a free application but: 1.
1079,Apps like Google Maps have many more interest points 2.
1080,The support of navigating between 2 points that are not my current location is not good.
1081,For example the source and destination names are not properly shown 3.
1082,The selected route did not use highways for some reason.
1083,There was no option to configure and control that
1084,App Cannot find my friends' addresses.
1085,Until that is corrected I am not even exploring other features  2017.07.29: Thank you for prompt response.
1086,"I am very familiar with Maps.Me but still your app cannot locate 80 Farmstead Road, Richmond Hill, Ontario, Canada."
1087,And many more similar addresses... Beside that if you offer routing form A to B please consider adding 'avoidance' (like toll roads).
1088,Without that is is basically useless as app always tries to route shortest way and if I go parallel road it tries to reroute me to toll road.
1089,Still cannot find simple address in Canada.
1090,Completely useless for online or offline navigation.
1091,Cannot get proper GPS signal (only that app could not) even outside in a very open space.
1092,"Also, most of the time, it cannot determine any route to go a specific address (including to go to international airports)."
1093,Bottom line: quite useless except to take a lot of space on your device.
1094,"ANSWER TO THE DEVELS: yes of course i checked my GPS location settings, i believe i made myself clear: this is the only app that gives me trouble, even other GPS apps are working correctly."
1095,"Please next time, read carefully the review instead of assuming i did something wrong."
1096,"2SD ANSWER TO DEVELS: I will try to be even more clear: I checked all the settings of the phone, i only have that problem with your app."
1097,"Btw, there is a more critical problem: it cannot find a route to a lot of destination, an international airport in my case."
1098,"3RD ANSWER TO DEVELS: Unbelievable, for the third time: YES I CHECKED ALL SETTINGS!"
1099,Note that i read your FAQ.
1100,This is the only GPS app i know that cannot route you to an international airport and i had the same pb with addresses on public roads.
1101,"4TH ANSWER TO DEVELS: no i am not contacting you, i use a better app and our exchange was unpleasant, it is enough."
1102,Gets the basics done I use this on my Galaxy Note Tablet and Galaxy S2 phone.
1103,It gets the basics done in a jiffy and I like being able to easily shift between my numerous blogs.
1104,"Nothing fancy like ecommerce posts or event posts,  but the browser interface has become more usable for those features on the go."
1105,I would suggest the ability to set a featured image though.
1106,Flawed update.
1107,Downgraded for now.
1108,"Very slow to load tabs, and switch between my site, reader and settings."
1109,Sometimes it just fails to respond and stays where it is.
1110,(All this on a good internet connection that loads everything well in another web browser app).
1111,It ultimately just refused to let me go back to 'view site'.
1112,Please fix.
1113,"Reverted to v4.0, which doesn't look as nice but does the work."
1114,Great for visiting a foreign country!
1115,It is a perfect app for travelling abroad!!
1116,Thanks a lot!!
1117,However i experienced some problems: i can't share bookmark sets with my friends!
1118,"They can share with me anything but i can share with them only individual bookmarks, one by one... very anoying when you have a lot to share."
1119,"mails, dropbox, google drive... everything is either telling that the file is empty or failed to upload... another thing is that when i moved the maps storage from the device to the sdcard, i lost all my bookmarks :-("
1120,Settings don't save Incredibly annoying that my KM to Miles & hide zoom settings get reset as soon as I make a search.
1121,"Also wish the searching was programmed to find words in a sentence and not exact phrases; couldnt find a result for ""tokyo tower"", once I manually found the location it had Tokyo Tower in parenthesis."
1122,Knows a lot of places though.
1123,Also REALLY wish the search button wasn't like 3 clicks away should be default on the maps screen
1124,Fair.
1125,"Guys, I really like the app overall, but the cursor was jumping around while replying to comments today, I have a hard time liking posts & commenting at times, and I would really love to see it function without switching to web & prompting me to login just to like, follow, or comment."
1126,"Also, it is difficult to follow others that have followed me without having to go to web, login, find them again, etc."
1127,"There are also places where the text gets cut off, like in stats & when viewing Gravatar."
1128,Doesnt really work on my asus zenfone 3.
1129,"Set my current location and my destination and press the start button, i can hear the initial voice command of direction."
1130,After that i presume the app will continue to run and i press the power button to off the phone screen and put it into my bag and ride my motorcycle.
1131,"Throughout the journey, there is no voice command and once i reach my destination, i took out my phone and unlock the screen lock, i found the app still showing my starting location"
1132,Worst example of optimization for android even Call of duty mobile doesn't lags or crashes like this.
1133,"When I am editing a post, the app automatically uploads it while I am editing."
1134,No I haven't kept the post as scheduled post.
1135,The block editor is worse than pubg mobile's rolling mechanism after landing.
1136,The selected text gets bolded or italics after 20 second of pressing the bold button.
1137,"It nearly takes 20 mins to write a post, but it takes 2 hrs to edit a single paragraph."
1138,F1RECHARGE Gaming.
1139,"need the full route I thought an offline map would allow me to see a whole route plan, and leave me alone about my location settings."
1140,I appreciate the tremendous work represnted by this app.
1141,It just seems like a betrayal to be forced to use navigation.
1142,"I want to reduce the amount of spying in my life, not add to it."
1143,Google Maps It Isn't!!!
1144,Does anyone who writes reviews for apps ever actually use them for more than 2 minutes before they write the review?
1145,They couldn't have for this app because it flat out does not work!
1146,I read all the glowing reviews about this app and decided to buy it.
1147,Bad choice!
1148,If you live in the U.S. and plan to use this app offline to find street addresses it won't work.
1149,Period.
1150,I tried several addresses in the metro area where I live and it found none of them!
1151,"It will sometimes find the street name but if there are several streets with the same name it will list them all and you somehow have to figure out which, if any, is close to what you're looking for."
1152,"And, Google, wonderful company that it is (not!)"
1153,gives you a whopping 15 minutes to try out the app and get a refund if you don't like it.
1154,"At minute 16, it's yours forever!"
1155,"How does a company like Google succeed, with business practices like this?!!"
1156,Horrendous!
1157,"If you expect this app to work anything like Google Maps or Mapquest, forget it, don't buy this app!"
1158,"So, wordpress has been good, great even until now."
1159,My posts are not having the comment section even though the settings are adjusted to that.
1160,"Then, when I delete a post, it only deletes on the site itself, on the app, it will keep showing."
1161,It's tiring really.
1162,"Then again, the app starts hanging when I am creating a post."
1163,Downgraded rating This app used to be perfect.
1164,Now I don't get notifications of new comments.
1165,When I click on comments it says 48 comments I have to type into the browser to get access to them as this app shows a blank screen.
1166,Once this was a great app.
1167,Why break something that once worked so well.
1168,I have thousands of people on my site every day.
1169,This app is awful.
1170,It's fine.
1171,It seems unfinished sometimes.
1172,The lack of street names in the voice navigation makes it hard to use for navigation unless you have someone with you to be the navigator and tell you what the app is showing.
1173,The lack of street names also makes it unusable for navigation on my motorcycle where I depend solely on the voice prompts.
1174,"To clarify, the streets were named in the app, and they even flashed across the top of the screen, they just weren't spoken in the voice prompts."
1175,Hard work This app is ok.
1176,"The end results can be great if you are patient, but the whole interface is just painful, and I end up putting off updating my blog because I know it is going to be a hassle."
1177,"There seem to be so many different areas to the app, all of which allow you to edit a post for example, but each with a slightly different interface and different features and options."
1178,"Yesterday I was previewing a post, found a mistake so clicked edit and went into a completely different editor, which allowed media insertion direct from hard drive rather than having to upload to library first."
1179,And now I can't find it.
1180,Could be great but is too messy and bitty.
1181,"Typical piece of software written by a large company with lots of developers who don't talk to each other, and no one person with an overview of what it is really like to use."
1182,I paid for this and now it's free.
1183,Typical bait and switch.
1184,Now they want me to pay for in-app unlockables.
1185,This is literally a crime.
1186,How dare you put ads in an app I paid for and features I paid for behind another pay wall!
1187,I paid for a lifetime ad-free license.
1188,At least give us a code for removing ads in the app you thieves!
1189,"""We need ads to stay afloat"" what garbage, 50 million plus downloads."
1190,I don't want to hear excuses!
1191,I'm contacting Google.
1192,Hardly Find a Spesific addres This is a great app.
1193,I already purchase and download Indonesia Map Pack  however.. its very hard to search spesific road or addres.
1194,"in indonesia, so many road name are excatly similiar, and the app cant find the best result for the road name or addres if you can improve serach location like google map does, it reallllly helpful"
1195,This app installs fine but then says it can't access the external SD card.
1196,My phone doesn't have an external SD card in the first place.
1197,I have plenty of GBs in both system and user accessible storage.
1198,Can this app not use onboard storage?
1199,"Don't bother sending some guide or a troubleshoot link, nobodys here for that."
1200,Doesn't post a new blog if I clear the 'uploading...' notification The new blog posting process is somehow interrupted and doesn't finish completely if I clear the 'uploading...' notification.
1201,As a user I would assume that such a process should continue in the background.
1202,"Next, if I open the app again, it doesn't show any indication of the ongoing process which doesn't give me any kind of update (of whether the new blog got completely/half way uploaded/or cancelled)."
1203,"To check this, if I manually click the 'refresh' icon on top-right corner, it gives a warning message which is really doesn't help the user what his/her action should be."
1204,Often adds random styles such as font sizes in the text resulting in an inconsistent look.
1205,You then have to go into the source mode and remove it.
1206,That is frustrating and time I wouldn't want to be wasting.
1207,"Generally the app is good and allows you to check stats, make tweaks to existing posts, create and publish new posts etc, so if they fixed the styling issues and GUI for text editing then it would probably get 5 stars."
1208,"Doesn't upload and deletes posts It will upload small posts with no pictures in them, but as soon as I attempt to upload a longer post with photos it starts a never ending upload which never actually finishes."
1209,Then when you go back into the app to see what is going on it deletes the post you were trying to upload and you are left with only the title and the knowledge that you have entirely wasted your time and need to write the whole thing and locate all the media files again.
1210,Totally frustrating.
1211,It worked fine on iOS.
1212,"More frustrating than useful, non-user friendly, glitchy Can't see anything on the page where you type your blog on the app, with the keypad obscuring everything even when I'm not typing."
1213,"Today (which was also only the second time), when I posted on my blog, WP wouldn't let me reposition images inside the article after adding descriptions to them, both on the app and the website and I had to add an additional note at the beginning of my article explaining the images, compromising its structure."
1214,"I'm new to WP and intend to write more, so please fix these asap."
1215,Lacks Control First feature I checked out was New Post.
1216,Where are all my extra fields?
1217,"I don't post a new item unless I can include special fields, include seo details and complete other plugin details."
1218,For me this app is only useful for comment moderation.
1219,Disappointing.
1220,Strips tags from posts.
1221,I loaded an unpublished post and used the app to publish it.
1222,"Even though it shows the brackets and less than and greater than signs in the editor, when publishing it removes them all, revealing the code - including WordPress brackets with potential PHP data."
1223,"1) Does not store its data in the proper path (Storage/data/Android/com...), but unnecessarily clutters the top-level storage (which also causes its data to be missed by backup software)."
1224,"I reported this over 6 months ago, but the issue remains."
1225,2) Navigation stops working if you turn off the screen.
1226,Leaving the screen on continuously burns through way too much battery to make this feasible during travel...despite this being a travel-oriented app.
1227,"3) As soon as you start navigating, the compass stops working (arrow no longer shows your orientation)."
1228,"They claim this is ""by design,"" but it is unlike all other map/navigation apps, cannot by disabled via options, & makes it impossible to know which way you're facing without stopping & restarting navigation"
1229,"Really great and helpful app, I'll recommend it for anyone."
1230,I also love that it saves work automatically even if you phone shutsdown.
1231,"But sometimes it gets a little annoying when you type and are all ready to post, then it publishes a previous version of your saved work - and not the latest one."
1232,But I really enjoy using it and navigating.
1233,"Thank you for making my work easy, I no write from the train, the bus, I don't have to carry a laptop around everytime"
1234,"This app is very very limited in what it can do, compared to the site."
1235,"Shame, considering users do most social media, photography and videography from mobile devices."
1236,"There is no ability to link to other pages on the site when creating a new post, aside from manually entering the URL."
1237,Feature request: Bring up a list of links to choose from on our own site when tapping the link option.
1238,"Nothing Special, Sadly As obvious as it is that a great deal of work has been put into this app, I feel its development is in a bit of the ""can't see the forest for the trees"" stage."
1239,"Without support for custom fields, taxonomies, and post types—and no support in sight, as far as I know—this app quickly becomes useless to a great many bloggers."
1240,Stats are great.
1241,Comments are great.
1242,Being able to actually update your website with new content outside of Posts and Pages is better.
1243,"Update: Taking the suggestion from dev to use the support, got response: the help support close until September 22nd (today is the 12th) ...."
1244,"Check the error myself, maybe the xmlrpc.php?"
1245,"install the suggested 5 year old plugin, rename the file, still cant, check forum?"
1246,a lot of the same problem but no answer.
1247,"This is fresh installed wp ---------- I never had success with this app for self hosted WordPress, two main problem, to login & to upload pictures, always this problem, i tried this app last year, now, the same problem still appear"
1248,Maps are stored on internal memory by default.
1249,Even when app itself is moved to SD.
1250,There is no option in settings to change the location of maps to SD card.
1251,App has to be open all the time during maps download.
1252,If you move to other app download stops and has to be started from the very beginning.
1253,Maps are not downloaded in background.
1254,"Leaving screen with download progress shown resets download from say 50 % to 0%, meaning you cannot use your phone during maps downloading process untill it completely finished."
1255,On the whole this is an easy app to use and creates a nice clean blog using the default Chateau template.
1256,However it doesn't seem to want to let me add pictures from my android phone gallery.
1257,"If there is a way to do it, it must be rather convoluted and byzantine, because nothing I have tried seems to work."
1258,"I can do it from my laptop, but not from my Galaxy S6 Edge plus."
1259,(Edit) - Just found a way to add photos - but still cannot do it while I'm writing the post.
1260,I have to add to the media library before I start the post.
1261,Does not work with several popular comment subscription plugins.
1262,"If a blog has comment moderation enabled, and then an administrator replies to  (and thereby approves) a comment which is ""pending moderation"" from within this app, the comment author will never get the reply notification email."
1263,"This is because this app appears to somehow bypass the `wp_set_comment_status` hook when administrators reply to a ""pending moderation"" comment within the app."
1264,The `wp_set_comment_status` hook is what fires the reply notification emails for many comment subscription plugins.
1265,"There is a clue that the developers know of this bug (I do see it as a bug) because, in this app, an administrator can ""Reply"" to comment that is pending moderation, but in the regular WP Admin interface, the button is labeled ""Approve and Reply"" not just ""Reply."""
1266,"I hope this gets fixed as it would be great to use this app to approve and reply to comments, and fire the `wp_set_comment_status` hook so that comment authors can receive email notification of the replies."
1267,Surprisingly bad I didn't expect this app to be so buggy and crash-prone.
1268,It syncs and updates posts only when it wants.
1269,It almost has an (evil) mind of its own and its main purpose seems to be to annoy.
1270,"If you dare to edit a post with the site admin, use unordered lists or bold and then upload it on the app, the tags appear in clear form (that is, using angle brackets)."
1271,Waste of time.
1272,Fits into the new trend of beautifully designed garbage apps.
1273,The OSM based app anyone can use search for smaller towns and villagesl (names that also appear as street names) isn't possible as the street come first.
1274,Can't change map layers eg cycle view.
1275,Can't change colours eg in UK motorways should be blue.
1276,Long distance drive directions prefer A to (faster) M roads.
1277,have to download small areas of one country one at a time to get routes.
1278,for example I tried to get route from Finland to U.K. but I works have to go all the countries along possible routes to get directions.
1279,"You should add full area map downloads to be easier like Europe, north America, central and south America, Africa and Asia could be made in two ţo five sections of download considering the area of those places and how large the areas are."
1280,other than that the app is great.
1281,"Usually prefer OSMand for its richer feature set, but maps.me has everything the casual user needs and looks a lot slicker."
1282,One point deduction for badly implemented OSM contribution functions.
1283,What kills this app for me is that it's chock full of tracking code that uses whatever you do to profile you and send you targeted ads.
1284,"Now I use the ""Maps"" fork from F-droid that uses the same maps without all that privacy-invading nastiness."
1285,Stay away from this.
1286,"Wanted an alternative for Google maps, but I need to use it anyway because this app finds streets but rarely any actual street addresses."
1287,"The search function is very frustrating and irritating too, with you not able to fill in a long street name and then add the street number to verify this app can't find that place either."
1288,Lack of aerial/satellite overlay option a big minus too.
1289,Could have been redeemed by bookmarks that can be imported sensibly.
1290,Unable to find location Today actually to get the some route I had installed this app.
1291,But the famous place in hyderabad chilukur balajai temple was not found which is my destination place.
1292,Dear team kindly add some important places such that it can be used locally also..
1293,This app makes more connection attempts than probably the next 10 apps combined.
1294,"Even before doing anything with it, and without running it, it's CONSTANTLY trying to contact Facebook & Google & who knows what else."
1295,"They blame it on the SDK, but a) it shouldn't be doing it when I haven't even launched the app in forever, and b) other apps aren't nearly as bad."
1296,"Pretty much every other app shows a handful of attempts, this one goes on for pages."
1297,& huge app size for what it is.
1298,"Meh Wordpress is a nasty, glitchy, buggy, irritatingly difficult to use piece of crap - on my android phone *and* windows laptop."
1299,And the text editor just lives right down to those awful standards.
1300,I only use it because it's become ubiquitous for blogging content.
1301,But I hate it.
1302,"Using wordpress in my phone's browser crashes the phone repeatedly, and using it in the app is impossible - the text selection tool is massively unstable, the side menu drags out when I don't want it to, the blog reader doesn't work."
1303,"UPDATE: I'd expected this robo response, because it's the only one given in this reviews section... ""call us""."
1304,No offense but that's the *laziest* way to handle common recurring tech issues... you (the user) do something.
1305,"Here's a tip:  put in your software an error tracking feature that uploads ""cannot post"" and ""generic"" errors and other similar ""cannot do that.. failed"" errors to you and YOU FIGURE IT OUT."
1306,I can tell this software is not robustly developed and tested.
1307,Another alternative would be for you to give meaningful diagnostic answers so we can all benefit from solutions found and discussed here.
1308,Terrible support model going on here.
1309,Original review:  Absolutely WORTHLESS and UNRELIABLE.
1310,This WP app feels like an Alpha version that hasn't been tested.
1311,Does NOT handle SHARING well if at all.
1312,Too many bugs and failures to list.
1313,Using Galaxy Note 8 w latest Androidd.
1314,Sad.
1315,This is late May 2019.
1316,Are you guys serious?
1317,I paid for this app back in May 2014 for an add free version and now you want to charge me again with a fee to remove ads (again!)
1318,?
1319,[My previous review from 2015]: All you need in an offline map application with the power of search and simplicity.
1320,"To Maps.Me staff: Really happy you listened to your customers and included basic navigation, great new feature and appreciate you added it!"
1321,App is definitely worth buying!
1322,Constantly locks up.
1323,"Paid to not have ads, after I installed the app I was getting full screen popup adds."
1324,Ads have gone away.
1325,I installed a monitor app to determine what was causing the ads.
1326,Just today installed the Maps.me update and will not run.
1327,When i move a downloaded map to an SD card Maps.me hand up.
1328,It's good but.....
1329,It's good but some more improvements required such as edit post quickly......
1330,"I am using wp but when I trying to edit previous post,option shows but not edit another problem is setting, view site,user options not working  and site stats shows too late please upgrade it's suddenly."
1331,"I downloaded this hoping to replace Google maps but unfortunately it's not  there yet, and I'm having to still use Google maps most of the time."
1332,"This  is mainly because the address search isn't very good, even if you try and  just make it simple and give it a road rather than a postcode a lot of the  time it can't find it."
1333,"I also dislike that, like, Google maps, the app  tries to hassle me to turn my location on if I start it with my location  off."
1334,Otherwise the app is fast and the quality of the map itself is much  better than GM.
1335,"Edit: an example of a search that doesn't work: ""Calvert  Avenue, London"" this search works on the standard open street map website"
1336,I had high hopes for this app but it's been disappointing on many occasions.
1337,"Despite downloading the required maps prior to losing internet access, they will not load when I am out and about without internet access."
1338,As soon as I am connected to the internet it comes to life.
1339,What's the point advertising the app as an offline maps app when it doesn't actually work that well?
1340,Photo uploading is decidedly broken.
1341,"The multi picker works great, but it is a coin toss whether each individual photo will upload successfully or hang at 80% and go nowhere."
1342,The only way to fix hung uploads is to delete it and then browse through your photos again to try once more.
1343,This is a huge burden when you upload 20 photos and 5 of them hang.
1344,This behavior is consistent whether on wifi or data.
1345,"What's more, the only intuitive options for a poat are ""local draft"" or ""publish""."
1346,"I can't get the app to default to ""draft"", in which it is uploaded and able to be edited on my computer."
1347,"Even if I only have the app as a way to upload cell photos, it is almost worthless at that."
1348,This app is a disappointment.
1349,The first release was not functional to reserve seats and even with the updates it crashes frequently.
1350,"It was exciting to hear about the new ""AI first"" mindset at Google, it would have been nice to see this implement something intelligent (e.g."
1351,"show near by events/activities, stop showing past events in list, etc)."
1352,"Worst blog app It works most of the time, but it likes to mysteriously delete parts of a post or a whole post when publishing."
1353,I spend an hour while traveling only to have my posts constantly deleted when I'm trying to write or edit them.
1354,STAY AWAY FROM WORDPRESS IF YOU NEED TO USE YOUR PHONE FOR A BLOG...THE SITE DOESN'T WORK WELL FOR UPLOADING PHOTOS AND THE APP CONSTANTLY TRIES AND EVENTUALLY SUCCEEDS AT DELETING YOUR POSTS AND PHOTOS...STAY AWAY...FIND A DIFFERENT BLOG VENUE!!!
1355,!
1356,A friend told me he could only scroll back to mid 2017 on my blog using the app.
1357,I figured it was his phone so I installed the app.
1358,I couldn't scroll further back than mid 2017 either.
1359,"So I asked another friend online, who I knew used the app, to check."
1360,He couldn't get past mid 2017 either.
1361,"This app isn't good enough if the visitor has to go to my website and using a browser, use the Archive widget on my blog."
1362,"If there is a setting that all 3 of us have overlooked, I'd be very glad to know what that is."
1363,"Otherwise, I'll just recommend the regular Dot Com site using a browser  Update April 18 2018:  The developers got back to me and informed me that the app can only handle the latest 300 posts."
1364,So 300 posts and that is it.
1365,"Since I write over 300 posts a year, well, that won't cut it for my followers."
1366,"The good thing, at least now I know why my friends couldn't browse my whole archive on the app."
1367,I appreciate the team letting me know.
1368,Last maps update is a disaster.
1369,"Can't update a thing, mentions lack of space due to limitations of Android 4.4 (I'm on 5.1 and have a 64GB card set as disk writing destination) and on it's own adds a list of Caribbean islands to the download list."
1370,"Can't able to publish post Hi, whenever I try to publish a post, I am getting failure message."
1371,An error occurred while uploading the post HTTP status code 405 was returned.
1372,Method not allowed.
1373,And search image option while setting featured image will be helpful.
1374,Improvements Private or password locked function does not work when you tap on 'view blog posts'.
1375,"In the event of 2 administrators, we are able to see a preview of the posts even when we password locked the post."
1376,"Also, it will be great if you could add in the feature that allows email notifications when administrators add a new post."
1377,Currently it is limited to only comments of individual posts.
1378,Thanks!
1379,!
1380,"Neat, but a bit useless."
1381,"This looks interesting, but desperately lacking in features."
1382,No options to work offline on posts like when you are on a device that doesn't have a permanent connection (think tablets).
1383,Does not find any posts that are already in progress.
1384,Editor is absolutely basic and near useless for anything more than taking a photo and adding a comment seems there are no advanced formatting features.
1385,"Multiple destinations please Currently using the app on my trip through Thailand, Cambodia and Laos."
1386,All I wish it had was ability to plan and save a trip with multiple unlimited destinations.
1387,"Also ability to upload and share a photo when adding a new place, or a rating function like Google Maps would be cool"
1388,Pros: + The map is clear and uncluttered + Fast & responsible Cons: –The search of an address is a joke: it's terribly slow.
1389,Many times doesn't find it and have to use an online map; when I went back to Maps.me to bookmark the place I noticed it was shown on the map.
1390,On the rare occasion the app finds it doesn't re-center the map on it.
1391,–When switching between apps Maps.me always re-centers on the current location; planning a trip with it is highly annoying
1392,"""...detailed maps of all countries from anywhere in the world!..."""
1393,"Not true - couldn't find Sherbrooke, in the Quebec province, in Canada."
1394,But Chibougamau map is available?!
1395,"It has a population of 7,541 people."
1396,"Sherbrooke: 154,600."
1397,Had to uninstall it - useless when it does not have the map of where you live.
1398,"Update: I found the problem - it started to download ""Quebec city"" and I stopped it, because Sherbrooke is in Quebec province and the two are not the same."
1399,"There are other errors, like Montreal city-Quebek, where k should be a c. Good thing this app lets you contribute to open street maps, but all those mistakes I mentioned are not OSM errors."
1400,"Map loading is zippy on the Nexus 7, but navigation is telling me to turn wrong way on a busy street in downtown Montreal and there are no alternative routes."
1401,Bloated piece of junk.
1402,search results for a train station or an airport will drive you mad.
1403,"trying to locate Amsterdam by typing 'Airport' or Airport Amsterdam will return every  business in the world containing the word airport, restaurant, bars, airport place, everything except the actual Airport."
1404,I guess developers  are too busy bloating the app (response time is so slow it is barely usable anyway.
1405,"Plan for a phone with 4GB orf ram for that monster., or go back to paper maps (which works WAY better if you need to find a train, an airport, a street."
1406,If all you need is to look for restaurants  I guess Maps.Me can give you some advertisement along your way.
1407,Otherwise avoid this thing.
1408,It's good but.....
1409,It's good but some more improvements required such as edit post quickly......
1410,"I am using wp but when I trying to edit previous post,option shows but not edit another problem is setting, view site,user options not working  and site stats shows too late please upgrade it's suddenly."
1411,Hard to believe this is the official app I just used this to perform a relatively simple task - edit a post and upload some images.
1412,"The post editor showed all the markup for links, formatting etc, which looks messy and is hard to navigate."
1413,"Worse still, I wanted to upload more than one image, which I wasn't given the option of."
1414,"I had to upload each one separately and re-find the folder they were stored in each time, which is time consuming and tedious."
1415,"The mobile website is flawed, but much better than this so I'll go back to that."
1416,I keep getting an Error Please fix this problem so I can write my blog!
1417,"I wrote a long post, now I keep getting an error saying I can't upload it because I have the wrong username or password... but I don't."
1418,Every time I re-login I get the same issue.
1419,People are bugging me to make new posts but I can't post them!
1420,Otherwise I love the app except for the way the cursor jumps around when I try to mess with the font.
1421,"Edit: after reading other posts and the responces to them, I now see this app has become obsolete... try to win us back"
1422,"Excellent maps (thanks OpenStreetMap), crappy SatNav."
1423,"I'm looking for a good offline maps app to use in my car, and based on the reviews and how the maps and routing looks on this, I thought I'd found my answer, big ""but"" incoming: I don't know if this is the same for everyone, but the app won't seem to recognise any street numbers, so any address I type will only find the street."
1424,Some streets are massive!
1425,this isn't useful.
1426,"Also quite often after searching and finding a generic town/street, I try to ""route to"" it and then get an error saying the app can't give directions to this location, try and be more precise."
1427,"So yeah, not really any use."
1428,Great app with some awkward features This app is really good for writing posts on the go/ staying up to date with stats.
1429,"To truly be a 5 star app, I think an upload bar should be added to posts/photos and videos that you're uploading."
1430,It's also awkward to upload a post once it's become a local draft.
1431,Edit: an upload progress bar is really necessary for the uploading of posts.
1432,New update broke upload It now uploads media before you can edit things like post category and tags.
1433,PLEASE let me done everything I need to for the post and THEN upload when and publish when I'm ready.
1434,I now need to wait around instead of posting a photo and hitting go.
1435,"Cant edit posts in App, need to go on wp-admin page through browser."
1436,No daily views shared without plugin.
1437,Setting option freezing so many times.
1438,Need improvements in application.
1439,Need regional support option with best integration
1440,A shame EXTREMELY poor!
1441,A shame.
1442,How about center and justify paragraph?
1443,Change post address?
1444,Open links in new window?
1445,A decent editor for the posts?
1446,Add images from Google Drive?
1447,Basic features are missing here.
1448,"Poor, POOR app."
1449,Disappoint.
1450,And there are bugs.
1451,Many times I cannot see recent comments and posts.
1452,Navigation stops working if screen turns off/device locks  Edit: really looking forward into working thin app in background as currently it isn't usable on bicycle or motorcycle as it is unsafe to stare at the screen all the time and it might be hard to see anything in direct sun light.
1453,It would be better to put headphones on and just follow voice guide as i do with other navigation app.
1454,But that other app doesn't offer bicycle navigation.
1455,Also when phone locks ans app suspends it looses GPS fix so it is some waiting time until location recovered.
1456,"Good at what it does This app is very fast, very detailed, and very easy to use; however, it offers no navigation features and no address lookup."
1457,You can see where you are and (with the paid version) you can search-for and pin the location of where you are going.
1458,"Without any form of navigation or route-plotting, you are left frantically zooming in and out to try and figure out your route because your current loc and your destination can only fit on the screen in very high-level zooms which don't show any useful level of detail."
1459,I tried reinstalling but the app is still tripping on my Galaxy S10.
1460,"Road names are illegible (black boxes), some other signs like street names too - they turned white (on white background), the scale is no longer there etc."
1461,Don't have time to send you an email and seek advice.
1462,Nobody ain't got time for that in 2020.
1463,"Will have to find another map app, which is a bummer after so many years with maps.me."
1464,"Btw, searching for addresses and buildings in general has always been a nightmare..."
1465,Needs Improvements Pros: - map looks good when loaded.
1466,- able to download specific maps - gps is good.
1467,- bookmarks   Cons: - can't search for addresses.
1468,- slow render speeds - outdated locations.
1469,- bookmarks need improvement.
1470,Please fix the issues.
1471,"I would love to use maps with me over Google maps but with the current versions features, I can't."
1472,"Keeps crashing When I first downloaded it, it worked great."
1473,"But now everytime I open it, it just closes after a few seconds."
1474,"I tried clearing all the data, rebooting, basically everything except uninstalling."
1475,It just wont work anymore.
1476,UPDATE:  Reinstalling fixed the crash problem.
1477,"However, all the maps that I previously downloaded onto my external SD card aren't accessible."
1478,"I re-downloaded a couple, but now it is putting the maps on my internal SD card."
1479,How can I change where these are stored?
1480,ANOTHER UPDATE:  Now it also won't zoom in closer than 10 miles unless I download the map!!
1481,It seems like this latest update completely RUINED what used to be a really good app!
1482,Horrible search capabilities.
1483,When inputting for example Kingston Rd.
1484,"It won't find anything unless you spell out in ""Kingston Road""."
1485,Also when searching for closest restaurant it doesn't show all options on the map.
1486,Instead you have to pick from a list!
1487,Really frustrating.
1488,Also lost my saved bookmarks of Trinidad locations.
1489,Hoping it was saved to another Google account but I don't see an option to select from alternate account to check.
1490,"Great extra option, give you an extra option to hold your website/shop in perfect condition."
1491,Read the last comments and remove or approve them.
1492,"EDIT: One mayor minus point, any reviews/comments they are NOT synced."
1493,We moved to much larger VPS and decided to give all sites a new fresh look.
1494,"No products, no comments and no reviews."
1495,Still the app is fully loaded with old data.
1496,We use it more like a extra layer of security than anything else.
1497,I've relied on maps.me for a long time as an offline backup to google maps and it has served me well.
1498,Sadly the current iteration has push notifications with no obvious setting to disable.
1499,While I can disable all notifications from the app at the system level this does not bode well for the direction of this apps development.
1500,I will be searching for an alternative.
1501,Not giving five stars.
1502,You've still got bugs.
1503,"In 'My Profile' section, I can't correct notification settings as, half of the blogs I follow don't show up."
1504,I have to go to my PC & do it from there.
1505,"Next, the news feed isn't complete."
1506,"It will show me some new posts then, it jumps to three days later."
1507,"Next, when I try to upload pix and make a post, WHY is there all of this extra HTML nonsense?"
1508,"Next, I changed my profile icon on the PC (not site icon)."
1509,Why doesn't it show up here?
1510,I need to reset app's cash each time i need to define my current location.
1511,Otherwise it shows last one it remember.
1512,BTW even after cash reset it did not navigate me by the route - the arrow just stack in the beginning of the route and that's it.
1513,"Almost useless when travelling, but offline maps helps"
1514,Edit: I paid for this app in 2014 ($4) so make an option for paying users to not see hotels!
1515,Used to be the best with no extra clutter.
1516,Not any more.
1517,Why can't I disable to not show hotels.
1518,They take up a lot of the screen and street names.
1519,"This app is paid for, why do they need to force me to book hotels through their app?"
1520,"Edit2: ""We used all earned money for the app development"" and then you change business model?"
1521,WHAT A SCAM!
1522,You should refund all paying customers or give ad free app!
1523,"Voice guidance during driving is not as good as on Google Maps, e.g."
1524,"no ""turn left, then turn rught"" if next turn is immediately after current one."
1525,"No voice advice and no sign like ""use the 2nd lane to turn right"", if 2nd is better to, e.g."
1526,turn left then.
1527,Streets that I don't need to use for my way are hardly visible during navigation which makes harder to compare map to actual turns on my way and consequently makes harder to define whether actual turn I approach is the one map talks about or it's the next one.
1528,Please don't hide turns that are not part of the route!
1529,Until that I prefer other navigation apps.
1530,Text on the map made adjustable - thanks.
1531,Please roll back to Older Version Why was WordPress came as app?
1532,"Previous version was quite simple, easy and worked for mobile with even 2G."
1533,You know the facts about mobile internet speeds.
1534,The newer version has many cons.
1535,"Please remove image preview under each post listing as it takes much time for me to navigate to Older post even when I am on WiFi, it doesn't even load on mobile with 2G or 3G."
1536,Graphically its good but ground reality is that I have stop accessing my sites from WordPress mobile app.
1537,I Rolled back to Older Version via APK.
1538,I can't tell how good or bad this app is as it won't let me log in to my self hosted website.
1539,It doesn't recognise my details but they work when I log in on a web browser.
1540,"I'm hoping it is better than the last version, which had random error messages when I tried to refresh any page (particularly the comments section)."
1541,Make new posts but... ...just don't try to edit existing ones.
1542,App will embed format code into the text and render it garbage.
1543,You'll have to go in through WordPress and spend a lot of time deleting out all the crap.
1544,"Fix THAT, WP and I'll give you 5 stars."
1545,"Until then, I wont use the app."
1546,Resident/village categories were missing + suggestions.
1547,"Everything is missing, lacks of details."
1548,"When adding locations, it should show like 8 tiles with icons which are easy to understand at a glance, then users can tap the right one very quickly &gt; then tap the sub category &gt; until found it."
1549,"Believe me you need much much more detailed maps, please make the submission process attractive and quick enough."
1550,I'd keep it as an alternative and will stick with Google Maps for now.
1551,Good but...
1552,"It is a very good app works smoothely, but lately moves my maps (in sd card) to internal memory (pretty tight in my galaxy S4) despite I indicate route to maps is sd."
1553,Once the maps are in internal memory there's no option in settings to tell app maps are in sd.
1554,Maps storage option dissappeared from setup menu...
1555,I guess this is a bug...
1556,"Thanks for your reply,  it happened again,  I'll send you an email"
1557,"good needs some basic improvement and to add some rudimentary features like adding a sign after you visit a place either bookmarked or is a part of some guide to know which place you already visited since some of us visit dozens of places and just a few at a time and also when downloading alot of guides make an option for them to work as one option instead of confusing us with all the different colors, been using maps.me over 2 years now and i really want to keep using it so please update it"
1558,I use the app since 5y while being on the road.
1559,The maps are awesome and are showing most of the time even small bush tracks.
1560,The search for location names is annoying from time 2 time as you see it on the map when you zoom in but can't search for it.
1561,The voice guide is not accurate too often and that's the main reason for 3 stars.
1562,"Not able to say the correct exit in plenty of roundabouts, slight left/right on straigth roads or on 180degrees corners or in roundabouts when to go straight"
1563,very very slow download of a 100mb file.
1564,a 56k dial up is faster!
1565,cant make any route example from a to b bec it need map download but it cant download bec its very slow.!
1566,are you kidding me?
1567,i haver steady data connection.
1568,anything else loads asap.
1569,only this app is doing nothing.
1570,your respond is a joke!
1571,All of a sudden this app has turned rubbish.
1572,"It was good a couple of years ago and I used to recommend it but tonight it has issues : 1) cannot locate me using wifi, phone signal, GPS...it states that I must be in a building."
1573,Google maps locate and finds a gps in this same location.
1574,"2) does not find Danang, Vietnam...it just lists a load of places in China So it's now proven to be unreliable when I most need it."
1575,Time to uninstall and stop recommending.
1576,"Primitive, big and slow."
1577,"No openstreetmap data choice (cycling, hiking,  etc)."
1578,No satellite imagery.
1579,No street view.
1580,Primitive track/route editing.
1581,No off-road (point vicinity) navigation.
1582,Compare feature set to Locus and  Oruxmaps.
1583,Developer replies make incompetent impression.
1584,This has been a disaster ever since Gutenberg came out!
1585,"Even with the recent updates, stats still don't work and seems to think I don't have jetpack installed."
1586,"I can't view my posts in the app let alone edit them, and ""schedule"" posts hasn't worked for months."
1587,"Also, wjen I try to log into admin from the app to try and work out what's going on, if claims my username and password are incorrect."
1588,WordPress is becoming less and less user friendly with each update!
1589,Today an update!
1590,What have you done!
1591,8.8 is foul!
1592,"I go to write a post, title in, picture added ... but it will not allow me to press return to write beneath the picture."
1593,What the hell is going on?
1594,"My return key says ""done""  I am unable wither I write first or insert media it makes no difference."
1595,I can not press the return key to drop a new paragraph or add on a new line.
1596,Please correct this or help !
1597,"Plenty of incorrect information, very lacking entries (it has a million hotels but none of the grocery stores), no way to report incorrect places in app, very meandering unoptimal walking suggestions and flat out incorrect public transport suggestions."
1598,It only gives you one route you cannot edit so if that bus or metro is out of commission good luck figuring out an alternative because maps.me won't help you.
1599,Edit: it is possible to add new info but not possible to report incorrect info.
1600,I can't download maps anymore even if i'm connected to the internet.
1601,"I even tried to clear data, erase all the files, uninstall and install again but again it's not fixed."
1602,😓😓🙁 Edit: thanks for the tip and pls add more detailed information about some locations because some are not found in the map..🤔
1603,Bugs-Won't sync media library Uploading new images never puts them on the blog.
1604,New posts including those images don't display them.
1605,Can't proofread or spellchecker and hyperlink button doesn't work.
1606,Stats don't let you see most popular posts or hits over all time
1607,Very nice detailed map program.
1608,"Today I used it for routing, I would not recommend this app for route planning."
1609,Some tips: If you know youre global route download the maps for routing.
1610,Second: while driving the application is very keen on directing you to a motorway.
1611,"Once decided which motorway to us, the app is willing to direct you a few miles in the wrong direction instead of choosing the shortest/fasted link."
1612,Also I noticed that is does direct you to closed roads (andosm use the same maps not having this problem).
1613,"Last: In the options I noted that I do not want to use an internet connection, why is a popup occuring when I am driving stationg that I do not have Internet enabled?"
1614,"I was disappointed that you can't just input a postal code for a location, which can be easier and more sure way than to pick out of a list of similar names in different locations (less chance of error)."
1615,"I did like that you can choose among different methods of travel, including by bike, although it grossly over-estimates required time by about half, or by a third when compared to Google maps."
1616,This app is very good if you need a map while not connected to the web.
1617,This app has a long way to go.
1618,Update: I have had this app for sometime now and they have done a good job making it better.
1619,I find myself using it more often than when I first purchased it.
1620,I would go 3 1/2 stars if I could.
1621,Offline maps are good some map data is off ie street names that have been changed 5+ years ago.
1622,Address search is not working properly.
1623,Google is much better currently having to download off line areas.
1624,Will be only using for general map usage.
1625,Using an LG G3 (with a custom Nougat rom; CRDroid) and I'm getting just black where the map should be.
1626,It seems to be interactable (I can tap on invisible things in the darkness and get interaction with buildings).
1627,The traffic toggle and zoom buttons etc are visible.
1628,The compass direction shows if I search for a place.
1629,I just can't see anything on the actual map view itself.
1630,Is there anything I can try to fix this?
1631,Just started using this app.
1632,"Maps are great but I am unable to download any guides, maybe the server is down?"
1633,Turn by turn directions are great but the app stops tracking movement when the screen is turned off to save battery.
1634,It would be great if it continued to track movement when the screen was off and also if the screen turned back on for a short while when approaching a turn.
1635,Maybe in the next update?
1636,CONS: - I paid for the app way back when you had to purchase it.
1637,"Some time later they made the app free but filled with ads, and now you have to buy subscription to remove the ads."
1638,This is the primary reason for 1 star rating.
1639,- Car navigation is so bad it's practically useless  PROS: - Good offline map support for when you visit countries where you have no service so long as you do not need navigation - Maps include hiking trails which is very useful if you're hiking national parks and you want to check where you are on the trail.
1640,The hiking trail maps are actually better than Google's.
1641,Update: **updated the other day and it's now unable to upload a post.
1642,"No way to stop it from constantly retrying, either."
1643,No way to easily find drafts.
1644,Great for managing comments but otherwise useless for me.
1645,Will have to uninstall to stop the constant retrying to upload.
1646,**Handy for typing up quick drafts when inspiration strikes but I can't imagine actually doing all your blog publishing from it.
1647,"DEVELOPERS - PLEASE create the option to set the post type to ""draft"" as a default."
1648,I've almost accidentally published just a few sentences intending to create a draft several times.
1649,It's a pain to have to change that every time.
1650,"Or if that's already an option, where do I find that setting?"
1651,Some Annoying Issues...
1652,"The ""tips"" that show up can't be turned off and don't ever go away on whatever activity they appear on."
1653,"When there is a tip, it is impossible to click anything behind it."
1654,Very annoying.
1655,"Next, in landscape, they have disabled the full-screen editor."
1656,I can't see anything I am typing.
1657,Not all of us use tablets and all of you app devs REALLY need to STOP disabling the full screen editor.
1658,That alone makes this 2/5.
1659,Also doesn't save html like setting paragraph text-align to justify.
1660,Practically useless.
1661,"The app is amazing, maps are amazing, just been to Venice and was really happy with it."
1662,There's only one problem.
1663,"The GPS doesn't show you your exact location, it shows you a location in a 300 meter radius from where u actually standing."
1664,"If you can fix that, I'll give 5 stars"
1665,Bhutan I would have rated 4 or 5 stars like others but since i live in Bhutan and there is no district except for capital Thimphi included in it... i would rate it 5 star if the maker of this app includes all the district or places in bhutan not just thimphu alone...
1666,"""Best App of 2014""?"
1667,I'd sure hate to see the worst!
1668,I'm guessing the reviewers who rated it #1 tested it exclusively in one state because this GPS app can't even cross map boundaries.
1669,"If you want to go from Burbank to Las Vegas, you'll have to set up the California portion, then a separate Nevada portion."
1670,Unbelievable.
1671,Selecting a destination is an awkward process that involves manipulating the map.
1672,Sheesh!
1673,"The best Android GPS I've found so far is ""MapFactor GPS Navigation"", which provides a variety of ways (such as Google Search) to quickly select any number of waypoints and destinations, plus traveling between states is not a problem."
1674,Basically nonfunctional.
1675,I've never been able to complete even the most basic post with this app.
1676,"If there's a photo, link, or absolutely anything requiring code, the app removes the code's formatting prior to saves and uploads, meaning my posts just show a bunch of partial html along with my text."
1677,It's crazy making.
1678,I just use it to reply to comments.
1679,Trying to start a new blog and it's pretty frustrating.
1680,"My images wont upload, my blog post I typed up wont upload and I'm just confused and feeling defeated."
1681,Not easy to use this app at all.
1682,I may as well just create a new site from scratch.
1683,Always an issue with WordPress..
1684,I put images in my post.
1685,The cursor is blinking on an empty line in between two pictures.
1686,I want my cursor control.
1687,I press on the empty line.
1688,Image settings?
1689,"No thanks, just want my keyboard back."
1690,I hit the Menu button.
1691,Nothing.
1692,There is no keyboard available to hit backspace.
1693,Must use dedicated back button which does not perform desired function.
1694,Post is not formatted properly.
1695,Restructuring the post is not user friendly.
1696,Does WordPress really want a user friendly gui?
1697,I hope.
1698,"Also, I cannot scroll up or"
1699,"It's been a very handy and useful app, and from the functional point of view continues to be."
1700,But I'm VERY disappointed with the latest update which started to show me ads in the Bookmark's pane.
1701,It is really annoying (especially animated ads) and eats valuable space.
1702,"I would rather buy a paid version of the app, instead of being forced to see ads in the app I use a lot."
1703,"Please consider removing ads or introducing a paid version of the app without any ads, instead of turning into yet another ad"
1704,Great tool but runs horribly on my phone at least - even after latest bug fix update.
1705,"Super laggy to open keyboard on search, freezing and crashing often."
1706,Sometimes zoom buttons are missing or not in their usual screen location.
1707,Resets my phone frequently.
1708,"Also, it has start-up (start after boot) permissions ?"
1709,Why?
1710,It slows my phone.
1711,There are two reasons to uninstall such kind application.
1712,"Offline maps and navigation pretty good, but not enough."
1713,"People, look at PERMISSIONS in App Manager and pay attention, firstly, when you install some new one: Google Play lists all."
1714,"I want more info in Stats Before the most recent update I could see Search Engine Terms, which are very important info."
1715,"With the update, you've taken that away!"
1716,Please add it back to the Stats!
1717,"While your at it, remove the tags & category, publicize, videos (because it doesn't work), and comments sections."
1718,Or at least make it so we can choose what info we want to see in our Stats.
1719,Sluggish and insanely slow!!
1720,"Won't remember where i left off, start screen takes forever to load and has no useful information."
1721,"All in need is schedule, and takes me several taps to reach where I wanna go."
1722,"It doesn't even check the date and time to show me the event I am looking for, takes me right to first day 9 am, but hey, its the 3rd day!!"
1723,!
1724,"I do like the feature of offline maps and being able to put down multiple locations pins to save specific locations, however I am not able to even look up specific locations..."
1725,"When I type in the complete address for a house, the map only shows how to get to the entire street, which some roads can be very lengthy, and not to the specific house."
1726,This asp is awesome.
1727,Just used it in Asia for the first time and it was a great help.
1728,"I love the fact you have all the shops, ATMs, etc."
1729,offline.
1730,But it really has issues with GPS.
1731,At first I thought it was my phone but it happens on multiple devices.
1732,Sky is clear and it searches for ever to get location.
1733,One way around it is to force close the app and reopen it but even that doesn't work sometimes.
1734,I really would give this a 5 star rating if solved in future updates.
1735,Keep up the good work
1736,"severely flawed app I was favorably impressed with the quality of the maps that came with Maps with Me Light; so, I ordered the full version."
1737,"However, I found that full version severely flawed."
1738,"While the program correctly identified my being at my home, and while it correctly identified the name of the street I was on, when I tried to search for my full address, including the house number, it could not find the address and suggested similarly named streets in other towns."
1739,"When I asked for the Walgreen pharmacy, it identified such pharmacies in distances of over 4 miles, but failed to identify the pharmacy that is less than half a mile from where I was."
1740,"When I asked for restaurants, it failed to identify the 99 Restaurant two blocks away from my home, while identifying another restaurants offer the same chain, several miles away."
1741,"In my opinion, the application completely failed the test."
1742,"If I were in an unfamiliar city, (which is the point of a mapping application), I need to find the nearest gas station, ATM, pharmacy, or a specific address."
1743,"If I cannot rely on Maps with Me to do that, I have no use for it."
1744,I have requested cancellation of my purchase.
1745,FUBAR !!
1746,Tried downloading the complete set of maps (about 25 GB) and it screwed up at around 4.5 GB.
1747,Would not download any maps at all.
1748,My connection was fine BTW.
1749,Am going back to the app at F-Droid.
1750,Probably won't have the routing feature or the most recent updates but at least it works.
1751,Beware: If you have the F-DROID app and uninstall it all your maps get erased.
1752,I lost 25 GB of tediously downloaded maps when I decided to go with the Google Play version.
1753,FWIW...... reinstalled the Google Play app.......Still NO GO !
1754,!
1755,Strange defects and incapacities I was able to post immediately with simple text updates immediately.
1756,Fine so far; one star.
1757,"I was able to edit a post immediately, and add a photo."
1758,"That's good, too; two stars."
1759,My edits DO NOT SHOW.
1760,Not so good.
1761,Minus one star.
1762,Video cannot be added from my phone; minus another star.
1763,The message that tells me that leads to a non-mobile-optimized website for a videohosting/upload site; minus another star.
1764,"I would have paid for an app that would allow this, but not an ongoing fee of US$60, thanks."
1765,Not going to ding you for trying to make a living; I don't blame you in the slightest.
1766,Just try not to make your sales pitch so obnoxious.
1767,Am i missing the spell check & grammer features?
1768,Surely a blog posting app would include that.
1769,It was stated that these features were removed from the website because browsers come with them now.
1770,Not on my tablet they don't.
1771,So i decided to use space on my tablet & download the app because that would HAVE TO included the basics...
1772,"The app is horrible and if you're thinking of blogging from your phone, you've been warned."
1773,"The posts lose formatting when hou want to edit them after posting, all paragraphs are gone."
1774,Inserting photos breaks words in the middle.
1775,Photo uploads hang and keep hanging.
1776,The app doesn't support raw format but lets you choose raw format to upload which results in upload failures.
1777,I will not buy any paid plan for this type of service.
1778,"""Media could not be refreshed..."" (still), and now I can't paste."
1779,"Not using  SwiftKey, not using the default Samsung keyboard."
1780,"WP used to be great, but  it seems like every update makes it worse, not better."
1781,I don't need new  features; I need an app that has its basic functionality.
1782,"I want to love this app, but can't."
1783,"Searching has too many problems: locations don't return results, and switching between map/list view makes some entries disappear."
1784,"I love the spirit of this app, but without reliable search, I cant use it."
1785,UPDATE: I worked with support for 3 separate bugs.
1786,"They were pleasant and prompt, but 2 of the issues remain, and they are deal-breakers for me."
1787,I genuinely look forward to using this app in a year or two when its more reliable.
1788,Very difficult to search between places The Maps always shows the place we are now and to find the route to other place is very tough as the search button is not there like in Android Maps.. And cannot search route between two other places... Not a great app ....
1789,i love this map for hiking and offline information.
1790,"however i have used it for navigation with my motor vehicle and it can rarely find the place im looking for, so i have to search then input the whole address."
1791,i may try again as ive banned all google's nosy prying apps including their maps.
1792,if i retry maps.me I'll post an update.
1793,"Well after down loading this app I tried to get a route from Benidorm to my house in Balsicas, Murcia, and it would not recognise my Calle."
1794,So I looked on the map area only to find my street has the wrong name and the name of the street is shown as a street one block away.
1795,As one is supposed to be able to correct errors how does one do this?
1796,as I can't find any instruction to allow me to correct this error.
1797,May be able to up grade star rating when I have used it.
1798,"Ok for simple text but shear horror if you want to upload images.Upload is interrupted most of the time leaves the local media cache completely broken.No easy upload of multiple images (workaround via filemanager share dialog), no progress bar on upload (no idea if finished, incomplete or still working).Crashes if accidentally refresh media library during upload."
1799,"Please devs, add a decent way to upload images with progress info and feedback if it was successful or failed."
1800,Otherwise it's a real pain in the ass to use the  app.
1801,"There should be a way to manage saved posts (sort them, put into collections, etc.)."
1802,"Moreover, the number of saved posts shouldn't be limited."
1803,"Actually the old ones don't get unsaved (when I view them on browser, then choose ""View in Reader"", the posts are still marked as ""Saved"") but they are not displayed in Saved posts so I can't access them offline (which is the reason I use the save function)."
1804,"And when visiting someone's blog, I prefer seeing an outline of their posts, which can help me access ANY post of that person, over an incomplete list of posts sorted chronically which doesn't display all of their posts (some of them are only accessible on the app through browser, so what's the point of using the app over browser?)"
1805,"I love the app, but it is very slow, it has always been like this, it's not encouraging me to use it when I have to wait half a minute to save anything."
1806,"It has had some great improvements throughout the years, better stats and more organized layout, it's getting better."
1807,This is one of my must have apps at all times.
1808,Wish you even more progress in the future.
1809,P. S. The preview inside the edit section shows a different layout than the preview outside on the front card of the draft
1810,Great if this will be fixed.
1811,The app doesn't seem check whether if an image or featured image attached into the post is already uploaded to the media library.
1812,"Everytime I updated a post or draft, let's say 3 times all images will also be uploaded 3 times."
1813,Sometimes the app says media upload error and if I try to update it back now found several duplicates of all the attached images.
1814,The set featured image also isn't working and rather insert the image into the post.
1815,Downloaded as it is supposed to support offline walking directions but it is rubbish.
1816,"slow to load and the search can't find a metro station as a starting point to walk from, not that was a big deal as it couldn't find the destination so I guess a starting point is irrelevant."
1817,deleted I'll go back ti Google maps and use them offline even thoughbit doesn't give walking directions but at least Maps can find the start and end
1818,"A significant backward step Now there is no way to select which maps to update, nor is there any indication of download size (why not?)."
1819,The option to download WITHOUT routing has disappeared.
1820,I do not require routing as I already have a sat nav.
1821,"Fortunately I have not updated my phone, only my tablet."
1822,I will not be updating my phone to v6 as this is the device I use most.
1823,Until now this was a 5 star app (and I had the paid version before it became free).
1824,Hugely disappointed.
1825,------------------UPDATE.
1826,Tried updating one small map (Guernsey 449kB) and found ALL my old maps had been deleted.
1827,The new style Guernsey map is 882kB.
1828,"I have backups of my old maps, so not a problem to recover them."
1829,I wanted to use this app so I could work on my blog on my phone.
1830,It would be easier to create thoughts in the moment when the inspiration hits even if I edited it later.
1831,However this app sucks.
1832,It used to be a good one where I could do so but now even when editing a post it rewrites words or letters I am using even though I am pressing delete!
1833,This really needs to be edited for it to be a user friendly site.
1834,Many people use wordpress for their blogs or websites so to me its unacceptable for it to be this hard.
1835,"Can't export posts , trying to move content between my two WordPress blogs , export creates invalid content , when I import the file WP that the email download links the WP import runner rejects it."
1836,"Doesn't replicate remote changes , made on server on my mac, to my app."
1837,"Think it is because apps local time reset to 01/01/1970 after last update , so I get sync errors when I edit posts."
1838,I'm done.
1839,Uploading images has gotten progressively worse and now I can't upload at all.
1840,All image uploads fail.
1841,The mobile app was great for quick posts and updates but like the web version it seems to have prioritized features and UI over functionality and stability.
1842,I'll try again in a year.
1843,"Useless search and routing function When I enter an address that I know is valid, app keeps giving a search error and tells me to change the search criteria...to what I have no idea."
1844,"I read the help and entered the address according to the example, but no bueno."
1845,"Google Maps has no problem with giving me routing intructions to that same address, but unfortunately, won't allow saving for offline use."
1846,"I Type an Article , then save it in draft for edit it later ."
1847,"When next day while i am editing that article , App get bugs and it stuck 😫 for minutes ."
1848,then that lag is gone and my edited article is also gone.
1849,this app wasted my 10hrs of Work in a minute.
1850,App is great.
1851,Super easy to create or update blog posts.
1852,Easy to use interface - clean and simple just like the website.
1853,BUT:   1.
1854,IT DOES NOT LET YOU MAKE LINKS OPEN IN NEW WINDOW/TAB.
1855,2.
1856,IT DOES NOT ALLOW VIEWING BLOG POSTS ON YOUR DEVICE'S OWN BROWSER.
1857,The Good the Bad and the Ugly Good Allows you to use offline maps when you can't use googlemaps.
1858,Allows you to bookmark different places with coloured pins.
1859,"Bad the search is painful, it doesn't recognise addresses so its a painful process of finding on googlemaps online then saving the pins on this app."
1860,"No Navigation, the follow me thing doesn't really help."
1861,"Ugly The price of £2.95 is too high, 99p might be a fair price I emailed the support a couple of days ago about how to copy my places to this app and received no response so far."
1862,Latest update data hog Latest software update used my network data to automatically download updated maps.
1863,No warning.
1864,Can't find an option to only update maps via wifi.
1865,Default should always be to update via wifi with option to use network data.
1866,Result I went over my 2GB allowance and got dinged for overage.
1867,I am not impressed.
1868,App is good otherwise but this for me is a significant flaw.
1869,It's coming off my phone until it's fixed.
1870,"Despite developer response, I just confirmed no warning message when download over mobile network."
1871,Why are good features removed?
1872,I used this app so I could easily access my wp dashboard for hosted sites.
1873,"It opens externally now, what the f will app do?"
1874,View stats and make posts?
1875,That's not why I downloaded this app.
1876,[EDIT:] Thanks for your reply.
1877,"Even without GPS, this would still be very useful as a detailed, zoomable map if it could be reliably used offline, as your description implies."
1878,"But the last time I tried to use it, it refused to run because I had no Net connection."
1879,"Apparently it wanted to check for a newer version of my map, and wouldn't let me see the one I had."
1880,"How about relaxing a bit about that, and letting us update when we can?"
1881,This app used to work really well until the most recent update.
1882,"Now when I'm writing a new post, it takes forever to catch up when whatever I'm writing runs on to another row so I have to carry on, hope for the best and go back and edit any mistakes when it's finally caught up."
1883,It's also almost impossible to start writing in a new block as the new block just doesn't appear.
1884,It's taking me twice as long to write anything now and is twice as difficult to use.
1885,Getting there but not quite there yet...
1886,I hate Google maps.
1887,Somehow it's slow on almost any device i have used.
1888,"Right now I'm using nexus 7 and it's still slow, even with the new update."
1889,"Mapswithme, on the other hand, is mighty fast but lacks in map data quantity, quality and the fact that the search function is useless."
1890,"The only way I've found it useful is to search for the street only, but even then you have to magically deduce which city it's located in by the distance from your position alone."
1891,"It's not very precise, also."
1892,"In addition, i haven't found a way to change the measurements to km's, so that's that."
1893,"Last, but not least - there's no decent navigation (the rotation of the screen doesn't count)."
1894,Good but there is some issues I have with it 1.
1895,The spacing can be annoying when you make a long post it does not goes down it just stays up you have to make it go down.
1896,2.
1897,You should be able to edit categories in the app odd you cant.
1898,3.
1899,You should be able to change the url for free atleast 1 time sucks you cant.
1900,4.
1901,Increase the GB size from 3 to 5.
1902,Update made it less useful Version 2.6.1 seems to have fixed the upload error issue.
1903,Thanks for the quick response!
1904,I'm still unimpressed with the changes to the interface but I can live with that.
1905,Original review: SGS III with Android 4.3.
1906,Uploading a post from my phone since the update results in an error notification 80% of the time.
1907,"And yes I am logged in to my Wordpress account,  Also, the new interface requires more steps just to send a simple post as the post settings have been moved to a separate page for no apparent reason."
1908,Great for posting on the go.... but not much else.
1909,"If you have jetpack, you can look at site stats."
1910,You can also review and approve comments.The limited functionality is why I didn't give it 5 stars.
1911,I understand XMLRPC can only do so much.
1912,One feature that I want to see is uploading images from the phone directly to the Media Library for use later.
1913,"There would be an entry added to the android ""Share"" context menu as well for that."
1914,We need to be able to upload files from this app.
1915,Like musics and other document files.
1916,Right now it's only Photos and videos which aren't enough And also we need to be able to search for categories when we want to post.
1917,Just give us a search bar there
1918,The reader I mentioned the reader I meant I'm not able to view my site in-app.
1919,I like using this app even when there's issues but I'd love it if the reader returns.
1920,I do like the addition of searching for posts via keywords & hope that stays.
1921,An improvement would be if the posts related to the keyword(s) weren't in random order by date.
1922,"Also, I've noticed when I try to visit self-hosted sites it goes to their blog in-app it'd be nice if they were available to view in reader."
1923,"when it comes compared to the browser edit!,as I suggest wordpress team to bring all facilities and features as such in browser edit as the version in browser seems higher when compared with the app...It is that when you cant add files in the app and some embedding doesnt support and the jetpack block is enabled in the browser version and that block is not supported in the app.....Few latest updates satisfy me comparing the last one's...so you guys are improving each step😍 and keep goin!�?"
1924,"300,org.stepic.droid,46.834890965732086,3,165,I have a problem with opening videos I just get the error that there is no connection while I am connected to the internet and I'm sure about it."
1925,Please help me I wanna use the tutorials but I can't.
1926,The deadline for the course is closed.
1927,"301,com.mapswithme.maps.pro,46.70327102803738,1,35,All the things about the app including map graphic and search results are great."
1928,The only big problem is that the gps point is jumping and moving suddenly during navigation and that makes it deserve one star.I sent a screencast of the navination of this app and another app to maps me group.
1929,I hope this problem will be solved for some devices.
1930,"302,com.mapswithme.maps.pro,46.654205607476634,3,170,Have used the app frequently on our trips for off-line walking mode routes and worked well."
1931,Just in the last week of a weeks long European vacation it has started to lag badly.
1932,We start to walk the route and the blue arrow doesn't move and then it suddenly jumps to catch up.
1933,This is even when we are out in an open area on a street.
1934,This was a great app and we really depended on it especially to find our accomodations in the historical parts of towns.
1935,Used to be 5 stars for us.
1936,"303,com.mapswithme.maps.pro,46.588006230529594,1,7,Weird."
1937,I live in Colorado
1938,"dear Maps.me administration, I hope you realize that after your latest updates, you've added an nonexistent country to your map, I'm talking about so called ""Nagorno - Karabakh Republic"" which is not recognised by any nation in the world, and considered as a part of independent Republic of Azerbaijan 🇦🇿."
1939,"those territories are under occupation, which happened after brutal war with armenian separatist."
1940,"Showing ""NKR"" in your maps, is denying 4 UN resolutions which are demanding to end occupation."
1941,"Handy, but with a few kinks Great app for quick updates or edits on your blog when you're away from a computer, but there are a few issues, at least on my samsung galaxy tab pro."
1942,"Editing pages or posts doesn't give you access to all features, and if you're reading other blogs, the comments section always says ""no comments yet"" even when you know there are comments."
1943,"Needs a ""find blog"" feature Having to search for blogs via tags or url is ridiculous."
1944,"This app needs a feature where you can follow blogs via similar interests, not merely by what is suggested by WP."
1945,I love using this site but it's not the best way to follow blogs.
1946,Pick up your socks WP.
1947,You're not new to this.
1948,I have been using this application for few days in Spain lately.
1949,After two days of usage I have sent a bug report to the developer.
1950,I was kind of expecting to get some response.
1951,Alas - no one came back to me.
1952,"Here is my original bug report:  1 - the maps are very good, with very aesthetic and appealing view."
1953,Kudus!
1954,"2 .- I have received few times failures in planning a walk, and was advised to define a different start or end point."
1955,I fail to understand both.
1956,3.
1957,There is a very unstable behavior you need to solve.
1958,"When walking along a planned path, even a very straight one, the view keep rotating clockwise and back."
1959,This is annoying behavior.
1960,4.
1961,"When walking along a plan path, the software does not take care to move the visible map window, therefore I have to take care of this."
1962,5.
1963,It should be possible to decide which data layer is drawn.
1964,"For example, when I look for a monument and the search can not find it and I want to finger choose it, I don't want to see icons of restaurants."
1965,6.
1966,There should be integrated icon explanation.
1967,7.
1968,I would expect a search that yields many results to sort them from close to far.
1969,In 99% of cases I need the closes
1970,"Needs better support on yotaphone UPDATED 2 STARS REVIEW: After using this app for a few weeks on my old phone , I bought a new yotaphone 1 solely because of the native support of this app for the e ink display."
1971,I was hoping to use the e ink display as an energy saving GPS navigator.
1972,"However I was soon saddened to find out that routing is not supported on the back display, and the maps that do display on the back do not automatically update to the current location."
1973,Blog's 'r US We use WP to do our travel blogs and find the interface from tablet to smartphone to PC clean seamless.
1974,Had some difficulties over slow internet (satellite) connections but it is rock solid with high speed terrestrial services.
1975,Posted text while away and imbedded photos later over high BW links.
1976,SOMETHING HAS CHANGED!
1977,I am now running WP3.6 on my new ASUS Transformer tablet running Android 4.4.2.
1978,Seems you have to upload photos to the media now or the app will freeze.
1979,Used to be able to upload directly from 'Gallery' .
1980,THis seems a clumsy way to do it.
1981,Not sure I'm getting the value from Premium....
1982,Cant enter street address numbers.
1983,The street I live on is literally listed in the wrong town.
1984,"It shows up on the map properly in the correct place, but you have to enter the neighboring town to find it."
1985,100% failure on the first search i ever tried.
1986,"Background battery draining Constantly using gps thereby draining battery, on a new nexus 5x, denying location permission to the maps.me app removes the gps icon from the status bar, granting location permission instantly puts the location icon back and battery goes down very fast."
1987,Cleaning cache from recovery mode doesn't help.
1988,Only uninstall or denying gps helps.
1989,Maps.me was gradually getting worse and worse after they become free and now they reached the point of total unusability.
1990,That's sad.
1991,Gotta move on to an  alternative OSM
1992,"Useless application, waste of money."
1993,This is useless application and waste of money.
1994,Never worked .
1995,"I have Sony Xperia, Android version 4.4.2."
1996,"Downloaded maps OK, but never was able to locate my device, shows only one location whatever I do, I travel to Germany and it shows me still in London!"
1997,"Travel in London and rebooted device and the app multiple time, still shows the same place where I installed first time."
1998,"Not well adapted for Android I'm quite satisfied of the blog as a customer, but as an admin the site is awful."
1999,"When I want to copy some of my text or even write a new page or article, the first screen thumbtouch engaging keypad, it goes to top page?"
2000,When I want to change for example title menu it refresh for each single letter???
2001,And there are few problems which i'm also not entirely satisfied.
2002,Can you fix it please?
2003,"This app doesn't fit on android phone, moreover since nothing has been fixed, I changed to 1 star"
2004,"Address search function doesn't work Not sure if I need to toggle online capability or what, but search can't find business names or many Street addresses."
2005,Sucks when trying to navigate when our of town.
2006,"I stopped counting the amount of app crashes, the forced detours and missed turnoffs due to the poor setup of this app."
2007,You should .never.
2008,"ever rely on it, but .always."
2009,"have to verify the routing, else you suddenly end up on a road running parallel to the highway, instead of on it."
2010,How often did the app not detect my location and claimed me to be in a building or tunnel?...
2011,The one and only reason I still have it installed is that it has been the first running offline... call me sentimental.
2012,"Does not support custom post types This would be a nice app, except there is no way to view, edit or create custom post types."
2013,That's a deal breaker.
2014,What good is an app if you can only access half of your content?
2015,It would be nice to see the pictures when editing a post.
2016,Each time when I  edit a post I can only see the link of the pictures which is not useful  when you want to comment them... All the rest of the app is very well made  apart this.
2017,I'm still waiting for this upgrade before using it ;-) Update :  finally they made it :-) I have installed this app many times and each time  I'd expect to sea the pictures when editing.
2018,Last time I hope might be more  than a year ago and now it's working :-) cool!
2019,Thanks WordPress :-) Next  expectation: searching a post.
2020,I've got a 1000 of them and would like to  check again all the content I've written from the beginning but it seems  that I have to slide down the page for ever to be able to reach my first  post... Am I mistaken?
2021,"In theory, this app could be wonderfully useful for bloggers on the go."
2022,"The design, layout, and features provide everything I could want and need."
2023,"Unfortunately, the reliability of the app falls short."
2024,I run into problems almost every time I use it.
2025,"The whole app will freeze and crash any time I try to add more than a few pictures to a post, and what should take fifteen minutes ends up taking two hours."
2026,It is unbelievably frustrating.
2027,"Editing on a mobile web browser is even worse, though."
2028,"Very useful, but has its problems."
2029,"(1) the location often does not work, even with full bars in the middle of the city."
2030,(2) search results are sometimes very bizarre...
2031,"If I search for a simple city name like Hanover, it gives me a town somewhere in the US like 100,000 kms away when im reality I'm in Canada and the city is like 10km away."
2032,Both issues appeared on 2 different androids tested (android 6 and android 10).
2033,"It has trails in national forests and parks, too."
2034,"One thing to remember before wandering somewhere new, download maps of the place, while you have wifi or cellular data."
2035,I have more than once seen a disturbing divergence between voice guidance and the blue line marking my route.
2036,Follow the blue line.
2037,The lady is a tramp.
2038,"If you're a cyclist, you might not want to use this app."
2039,"The route it suggested from my house to Portland,Ore would have me riding on a busy highway when plenty of country roads would have been a better experience."
2040,Google Maps is better.
2041,"1 sMaps 1 Maps,Offline,great tool for the Blind,have to test with screen reader Spiel,Talkback,TTS,Test to Speech,will find did developer code scripts behing GUI's,etc.other Navigation with read the map and will Voice commands allow the route be coded ,otherwise delete the app,and no ads and popup windows and 3rd party tracking."
2042,"Okay for emergency but needs work on stats While this is a handy app for on-the-go posting or editing, the stats are not very useful."
2043,"For example, although it's nice to show that I had 905 hits from the UK or US, the fact that I cannot see which state or city within the countries listed, or even more importantly, the breakdown of the actual pages/titles for those area makes the stats useless."
2044,I recommend bookmarking your Google analytics page instead...
2045,Good enough.
2046,But need more features.
2047,I've just used a little just now.
2048,"And I found that on website, you guys have ""open in new tab"" feature when we add a link on text, so that users clicked on it, the link opens in a new tab."
2049,"But in app, there is no such a feature."
2050,I had to copy the html code from the previous link I've created using web version (on PC).
2051,That's not such a big deal.
2052,But I think you guys should add that feature in app too.
2053,Why change what works So I updated the app yesterday and wish I hadn't.
2054,"Was happy with the layout showing stats and view site together but now it has moved view site to bottom of screen and has a tab called Plan, which looks like a tool to sell your add ons."
2055,The map itself is good.
2056,thus it can not choose the route between highway and a free road.
2057,the main problem is.
2058,before i was sighn in into a google from this app.
2059,to keep organised my bookmarks.
2060,now my phone was little broke.
2061,i reinstall android 6.0 OS to my phone.
2062,then i reinstall maps.me and then.
2063,i was trying to sighn in into a google service from the app.
2064,to retrieve my bookmarks.
2065,but i get a message from google.
2066,that they not support this app anymore.
2067,because only browsers permitted to make authorisation requests to google.
2068,it's classifieds as embedded user agent also known as a web-view.
2069,anyway i can't get my bookmarks back.
2070,not allowed anymore.
2071,and google authorisation still there.
2072,kind of useless now for me.
2073,Only good if you know the place you are going to.
2074,Offline maps work only in the way that it gives a map for around your location while offline.
2075,"If you need to find a particular street number forget it, best it can do is tell you the cnr of x and y."
2076,For roads that are 20-30km long it is worthless for navigating to a particular street address.
2077,I have to whip out google maps to get that last 1km or so.
2078,"The addresses work best when you put them in backwards, even when you select the search on map option in search."
2079,It's just a mess.
2080,I really wanted to like this app.
2081,I wanted to love it.
2082,Good .
2083,.
2084,.
2085,But .
2086,.
2087,.
2088,Update Needs more work.
2089,The app also fails to load all followed posts.
2090,Unless you open it every few hours you can look forward to missing some of the posts that you would have liked to have seen.
2091,"I loaded my Reader in the app, and compared it with the browser version."
2092,In 12 hours I lost 50 posts.
2093,So.
2094,Useless if you only check once daily.
2095,Also needs better text formatting control.
2096,Cant connect Could be good but its useless due to the problem with establishing connection.
2097,I have to reload 10 times for my post list update.
2098,"Its the same with pages, stats, publishing a post, even with login."
2099,"I tested this on many wifis, with data on, on different devices, ..."
2100,Same problem everywhere.
2101,Fix it and ill give you 4 stars.
2102,UPDATE: if i could id rate this app -5.
2103,Its pure crap.
2104,"I was writing a long post, but this app only (due to its problems with connection) only saved the first paragraph."
2105,Uninstalled.
2106,Don't trust this app!
2107,The syncing feature is the worse!
2108,"I spent hours yesterday writing a post, posted, and when I opened the post on the app, I was going to change the name, the app synchronized a draft from 6 days ago (when I started to write the post on my phone) instead of updated the posted text on the phone!"
2109,"I lost hours of work, because now I only have this text from 6 days ago!"
2110,"Edit: at the same time I wrote to ""Help & Support"" and 4 days after still don't have an answer."
2111,Nearly no function worked properly.
2112,The app updated older versions of post drafts so that the recent progress was deleted.
2113,The draft mode does not show contents like lists or images.
2114,Uninstalled.
2115,"The mobile bowser version works fine, while the app is causing more problems than is solves."
2116,Would be a 5 star if it was possible to search through my bookmarks list to find a place.
2117,"I have a list of over 16,000 locations throughout the country, only about 200 of which I use."
2118,It would be great if I could search for the places I need.
2119,I am using the Android version on my Samsung S20
2120,Website says there is an option to add self-hosted WP site.
2121,There isn't.
2122,The app also refuses to let me login.
2123,Falsely says username and password are wrong.
2124,Won't even let me access settings.
2125,Contacted help.
2126,No response.
2127,Not even estimated wait time.
2128,Refuses to function at every turn.
2129,I don't understand this app does not work at all offline... What's the point?
2130,On my Android headset every search or navigation attempt fails to find any results after downloading the whole city which took hours.
2131,even for a city like San Francisco can't find anything unless it's connected to the internet - so why not just use Google Maps?
2132,Featurful but misses the mark Two problems I have are seeing the font when editing and finding a post that I'd like to work on from the posts screen.
2133,I don't know what others do with this app.
2134,"For the most part,  I just want to create and edit posts."
2135,"If there was a way to search posts,  and a way to blow up the font, I'd give this app a five."
2136,Can't log out ...
2137,"I am using the app on my Samsung Galaxy 10.1 Tab, I want it to access more than one of the blogs I manage."
2138,"I got the first blog up, ran a test post, great, went to log out ... can't get it done."
2139,"The only log out is in the dashboard that I can find, every time I try to get the pull down menu for the log-out I get a screen refresh, meaning I can not get logged out."
2140,Without being able to log out of one blog I can't get the other on.
2141,Any hints on getting the log out to work?
2142,"Other than that it appears to work well, with my first test post that is."
2143,I just want to use it for multiple Wordpress blogs.
2144,"#BUG...LOOSES CATEGORY All the posts for Self-hosted sites keeps loosing their given categories when a ""Publish"" button is pressed to post new Articles or ""Update"" button to update content and keeps sending them to ""Uncategorized""....plz fix this asap!"
2145,Think I'll stick with Google maps Can't search via postcode.
2146,It took me about 15 mins to work out how to even set a route.
2147,There is no obvious button to set a route which threw me unlike Google maps you have an arrow button and hey presto where do you want to go and you can only plan a route from your physical location.
2148,"Not for me, I enjoy simplicity."
2149,"I went to edit a post today in this app, and it randomly created and published an entry I'd already published before (a year ago), but made a new entry out of it and it's all jumbled and in one line across the page!"
2150,"This is really bad, I cannot have my blog with random publishings happening I didn't authorize."
2151,I now have to go through my blog and make sure nothing is messed up.
2152,"That was very jarring and I don't feel confident in using this app anymore, I'll stick to the website."
2153,"I was super impressed with the app up until I went to edit a published post, the app wasn't updated and showed my blog post as it's first orginial draft?"
2154,All my edits and revisions since then are all gone.
2155,It was considered a draft again and unpublished.
2156,That was days and days of work disappeared within seconds.
2157,I will no longer be using this app.
2158,Excruciatingly annoying Impossible to search without app insisting on downloading more maps.
2159,Deleting.
2160,Even after downloading a bunch of maps the app doesn't allow route planning.
2161,Just the boring freeways.
2162,Might as well use Waze or Google Maps.
2163,The search goes on.
2164,I also agree that the app does not work as it used to.
2165,"Previously you would enter the street number, name and town and it would come up but it now just gives multiple options none of them what you want nor does not give any reference to the town other than the main capital city which means you have to enter everyone until the correct one is found."
2166,It used to be a very good app and I used it constantly overseas but now I cannot as I cannot trust it will get me to where I need to go.
2167,I tried the OpenStreetMap you mentioned in the previous post and it gives me no option to tell anyone nor does it bring up the requested address.
2168,"No voice guidance I would really appreciate if you add voice guidance feature and more accurate for feature like atm, banks, gas stations, hospitals, service centres with names  restaurants, toll booth, famous temples other government offices."
2169,As well as arrows showing the direction of traffic.and also usefull feture like track recoder to save the track.and there are many new bridges and diversion which are newly made to save the time and traffic which still not added in your map.
2170,Pls make new update 4 above 5star next time
2171,The app kept crashing after I uploaded a draft with pictures.
2172,It wouldn't load every time I tried to edit a draft that contained pictures (it works for drafts that are all text).
2173,"Even when I restart the app, it will crash whenever I tried to edit posts."
2174,"Since I use the app to upload pictures easily, this app is now useless compared to the browser which can do the same things without crashing."
2175,"Poor hog This navigator is very poor in customisation options (no next turn icon/distance, no direction indicator, no speed limit warning, no speedcam warning/distance etc.)"
2176,"It also hogs on resources, downloading base maps as .obb files, which cannot be moved to the SDcard, taking about 50MB of internal memory."
2177,"Finally, downloading maps on a PC to transfer them into Maps.ME directory didn't work, it couldn't find them, re-downloading them and making me waste time (at least, those maps were on the SDcard)."
2178,Here is fresh bug report for you.
2179,Download maps for 2 countries that have mutual borders.
2180,turn off internet.
2181,"select location in one country and click 'roure to' select another point in second country , and then app tells you that system error has occured."
2182,"about a year ago it was saying that you need to download map in same conditions after a year it throws system error (no details in the message, consider giving more descriptive messages to user) , thats opposite to progress"
2183,GPS Bug updated.
2184,Has GPS bugs that make it almost unusable.
2185,No voice Nav and regular google maps is much less of a battery drain  GPS bug is as follows.
2186,"You can search for a location, but if your GPS wasn't already enabled it will constantly search never making a connection."
2187,You have to stop the app restart it with GPS already enabled and it seems to work for the most part but it was very spotty and it makes it extremely hard to use if you don't have time to stop and park and occasionally I had to hit the lower left button to make it connect again if it stopped working.
2188,"Was very weird, never have this problem in most apps."
2189,I'm a developer myself that's the only reason I recognize it as a bug.
2190,Will give it two stars because it got me back from St. Louis without getting me totally lost.
2191,"Like many other people, unable to fully use this app, as it seems to have an image restriction when you wantto upload and attach an image."
2192,I have gone through all the troubleshooting and even changed settings on the host/server and blog - still no difference.
2193,"In short, I have to re-size the photo in another app on my phone, then attach that smaller photo into the Wordpress post."
2194,Only an issue through the app.
2195,Following various searches and tests this seems to be an issue with the app - despite the settings I make on the app.
2196,Please fix this issue please...
2197,"Search function not working after update, tried zooming out without much help."
2198,"Routing navigation every thing is good, but search shows up in the list but not on the map..."
2199,"I started using this 2 years ago, and it was very good then."
2200,With recent updates the quality of routes for pedestrians has declined sharply.
2201,"I was recently in Manchester and could see my destination 100m down the street, yet maps.me wanted me walk 250m round a block."
2202,"It was giving me a driving route, although I checked, it was set to pedestrians."
2203,The version of a year ago was better for walking.
2204,"Not able to download Tamil Nadu, India Map."
2205,I have been using the app now for many years and it was working fine.
2206,"Now I'm not able to download/update Tamil Nadu, India Map and able to download other maps."
2207,"I tried all possibilities (clear storage, uninstall & reinstall, restart of phone etc."
2208,and still failing.
2209,I don't have any VPN and also I'm very close to the WIFI so no problem with that as well.
2210,"As TN, India is my birth state and it is bad that I'm not able to download the map giving 1 star"
2211,Do my self-hosted WP sites have to be connected with (paid) Jetpack to use this app integratedly?
2212,"Why are there too many ""not loaded"" in the tabs?"
2213,Or I missed something?
2214,"Sorry, I rather use WP manually from browser."
2215,It's just not as powerful and versatile as I thought.
2216,What a joke.
2217,No WSIWYG editing and the preview is also not showing what the post will actually look like.
2218,This app is totally useless.
2219,Update: Tried it again.
2220,Really wanted to be able to use.
2221,Still no usable editor where you can see what you actually get..
2222,Going back to the web interface (the classic one since the new one is unusable).
2223,"handy and accurate, but the search function only gives exact matches which is tricky when traveling in foreign countries, and it gave me a notification explaining the bookmarks feature after I'd already bookmarked several places."
2224,Minor but annoying
2225,The free version is fine.
2226,"It contains info on small alleys, which is helpful, although GPS gets lost sometimes (not sure if it's the app fault)."
2227,"However, I would strongly discourage to buy the paid version of the app."
2228,"The ""PRO"" maps have just wikipedia info, and they have mistakes (unexisting places, erroneous descriptions...)."
2229,"Really useless, and there's no option for refunds once you pay and discover these not so PRO features."
2230,Poor navigation and atrocious new download I live in Chennai India and used this for navigating direction to a popular destination and it was terrible.
2231,Wasn't aware of 1 ways so kept telling me the wrong directions.
2232,"Didn't tell me upcoming left, rights etc."
2233,The GPS location tracker worked well.
2234,The other thing I had the whole India map downloaded but with this new region download feature it overwrote the entire old map instead of updating just the region I refreshed.
2235,While that might b the new behaviour it didn't warn me this would happen.
2236,"search is extremely limited, app can't even find the place I am searching for when I am sitting in the parking lot right in front of it."
2237,"I understand OSM is crowd sourced, but at very least someone should be able to enter an address and find it, even if the business name isn't locatable, without having to rely on the community to do so first."
2238,Good but......
2239,The idea is good.
2240,But it lacks dynamic routes.
2241,I mean I can't alter the route.
2242,Need more improvements.
2243,Like altering the routes.
2244,Locating my current spot on the map.
2245,And navigating from my current location.
2246,Option of travel is limited to car and walk.
2247,Why not public transport?
2248,I need continuous development.
2249,One plus to the app as it save data and I can use it despite my poor data connectivity.
2250,Lost a lot of features in the app when moving to block editing.
2251,I can't change block types after they are created.
2252,I also can't underline text in the new app.
2253,Functional But Flawed I wrote an article and was saving it for later and then got a new phone and logged in and the article was deleted.
2254,Only stored locally?
2255,Come on wordpress.
2256,"I logged into my account, I should have all my drafts."
2257,Do they do much for the community of users also because I have only had 3 followers in 3 years.
2258,They should feature well-working websites.
2259,"Also, I cannot figure out how to do a sub category link from the main links."
2260,It goes dead.
2261,I will keep researching but some of it can be frustrating.
2262,"Honestly I love Wordpess and have been using it since the first few builds back years ago.I was so excited to have an app, but I first used it to post a step-by-step with several photos and it was a complete pain in the %~$."
2263,"I think this app would work best with media altogether if it simply let you upload your photos first WITHOUT making each one it's own post, then let you insert them from a gallery view as you need them."
2264,"Otherwise, just remove the current media options altogether and try again later."
2265,Few important options are missing 1.
2266,No option to set the main thing of the post - - featured image 😐  2.
2267,Not all options of editor are present.. Atleast first 2 lines of editing tools should be there.
2268,3.
2269,Open the image upload doesn't comes as it shows the broken image...
2270,Please fixx  these issues 😁😁
2271,"It loses my posts Year after year, the same crap....I just spent 45 minutes working on a post."
2272,"I pushed the button to publish, and Wordpress immediately said it could not publish."
2273,"(Not sure why, b/c my internet connection is fine.)"
2274,"It didn't save the post, the whole thing is gone, up in smoke."
2275,"This app might be good for a Buddhist who wants to work on not being attached to his/her posts, but as far as a blogging app goes, if it doesn't save your posts and loses your hard work, then it's crap."
2276,Don't bother.
2277,Frustrating at best When creating new posts or editing old ones it's nearly impossible to get the cursor to where you want it.
2278,Repeated clicking in & around the line I want the cursor to be gets it there & then makes it jump back to two lines above or where ever it wants to be.
2279,Also editing code to existing posts messes things up.
2280,Currently only thing the app is good for is approving/deleting comments.
2281,"When commuting & wanting to create a new post I now use blogger, because unlike this app, it just does the job."
2282,Please fix/improve!
2283,I've been with wordpress for years & love everything else about it!
2284,device: Galaxy S II
2285,Great before the upgrade I upgraded the app earlier this morning and now I am unable to save any posts with or without pictures.
2286,Please fix this!
2287,"4:54pm Update: The error message says ""an error occurred when loading media: no peer certificate"" I took the pictures out and it still doesn't save to draft or publish."
2288,It says local changes.
2289,I lost an entire blog post today of over 500 words because of this upgrade.
2290,I have never had an issue with this app since I originally downloaded it.
2291,Please correct this!
2292,I'm very disappointed with this app as WordPress is supposed to be the leader for blogging.
2293,Can't save a draft just on the device when there's an internet connection.
2294,Can't create a post draft with pictures when offline.
2295,"No control of the layout of photos when using ""Tiled Gallery"" and no preview of such posts."
2296,Unable to set geo-location for a post.
2297,This bug has been there in over a year and still hasn't been fixed.
2298,Always hangup on me.
2299,Not realiable I bought this maps with me pro.
2300,I kinda like  but it always hung up on me.
2301,"There are times when you change course and you did not follow the recommended route, after awhile it abruptly closed."
2302,There are times that it will closed automatically without apparent reason.
2303,We had to restart it several times in order to make it work.
2304,It's so frustrating in the middle of the navigation and you are kinda lost and this will closed automatically.
2305,I am using samsung galaxy note 3 for this apps.
2306,I am so frustrated.
2307,Reloading is not a good answer.
2308,I paid for this.
2309,I expect a better answer or another solution.
2310,FYI - Reloading is the next thing that I ever did once it's abnormally closed but it takes several reloading before it will be usable.
2311,Do you have an email add where I can stage my complain?
2312,I did.
2313,"I send an email to you last Jan 9 until today, I haven't received any reply."
2314,Nice UI update...but...
2315,The UI update was a long time coming...
2316,Still no option to hide the stats section that is useless to self hosted sites.
2317,Dashboard is just the web version?
2318,Wth?
2319,Media section displays blurry thumbs.
2320,Doesn't seem to have been tested out before releasing.
2321,Editing pages/posts is a terrible experience.
2322,Offers nothing for the seasoned users.
2323,Has a lot of maps but takes forever to download relatively small files.
2324,Also constantly saying failed download on this app.
2325,What should be simple is a pain in the butt.
2326,"I switched from here maps to this because this app has more countries available, but I feel like Im trading more countries that here maps doesnt have like japan but with a less quality app."
2327,I like the maps on here maps better too.
2328,"Oh well, Ill give it a continued try and see only because ive invested all this time in it so far"
2329,Please add a speed limit option.
2330,"In Japan, many people use scooters."
2331,50cc.
2332,The max speed limit is 30km/h.
2333,"So when I search a route using your app, it's always the wrong estimated arrival time."
2334,That kinda sucks.
2335,Edit: why would I download the updated app if you don't offer what I need.
2336,Fix the app and I'll download it.
2337,"Till then, see you Edit: you offer limited speeds for bicycles and walking."
2338,So it's not like it isn't being done.
2339,You can and are already doing it.
2340,Just add a moped option.
2341,"I wish this was better, then I could delete Google."
2342,This doesn't show alternative routes.
2343,"The search isn't great either, it often doesn't show places that come up straight away on the devil's Google Maps - I can often find roads, but when I type in a number on the road it doesn't show it."
2344,:(
2345,Terrible.
2346,Keeps coming up with couldnt sink doesnt show me any of my blogs.
2347,cant go on setting cant post nothing the only thing that works is view my site.
2348,It worked the first day i downloaded the app then i did some work to my site put some posts on etc and after that the app just went terribly wrong.
2349,whoever runs this app seriously need to fix it coz its just a joke.
2350,if i want to blog when im out and dont have a laptop with me i cant coz this app dont work.
2351,Sort this App out now!!
2352,!
2353,"Current Update many issues 1) Leaves GPS active upon exit, must force exit running background apps of Maps.me."
2354,"2) Since maps split, Favourites sluggish to completely unusable."
2355,Was supurb prior to change.
2356,"3) Current permission set way over the top, not openly documented."
2357,"Was a stellar app, going downhill exponentially."
2358,Android 4.4.2 Samsung GSIII
2359,"Useful, but needs work Hats off to the dev team ... this app is easy to use and does its job."
2360,"A major problem, though, with the Ireland maps (at least), was that route lines overlaid the street and highway names."
2361,"So, we could use this app only as an advisory to a physical map, where we could see actual street and highway names."
2362,Google Maps solves this problem by putting the route lines over the streets but under the street names.
2363,"Overall, close but no cigar ... hoping for improvement in the future!"
2364,Overall the functionality seems good however there's no sharing section in the Android app like in iOS.
2365,I have to go to mobile web to update.
2366,That's kind of pointless.
2367,I don't want to write in to development inside the app!
2368,Forward this to them geez.... That's not what I'm talking about and it's not in the app!
2369,Not sharing....
2370,Posting it Twitter LinkedIn with checkbox and default if title.
2371,Still not functioning.
2372,Add this
2373,"Well, the app used to work well until a few days back."
2374,"I can't view my published posts or my media anymore, it keeps saying unable to refresh, I can't even reply to a comment."
2375,"Now, I'm just stuck cuz it has refused to publish any post anymore."
2376,Please fix this.
2377,Why is this app here?
2378,Is it deliberate to just have reading functions only?
2379,"What happened to rich text formatting, picture uploads, feature image settings and easy post uploads?"
2380,I doubt this app would be on the Apple iTunes store with this rubbish.
2381,Fix up please
2382,Became worse It was excellent light app.
2383,Now it shows map quickly but does not respond to touches approximately 10 secs.
2384,Phone is hot after a few minutes of using.
2385,It shows hardware OpenGL requirement.
2386,My phone does not have opengl.
2387,But one year ago app worked perfectly without that.
2388,I AM SO SORRY I EVER INSTALLED IT.
2389,"This app is malfunctioning in several ways, relating to strange displays of blog text."
2390,Once OVERLAPPING so the post displayed UNDER or OVER the photo of prior post.
2391,"The next time, yesterday, so the text displayed WAY OUT TO THE RIGHT."
2392,"Reader has to swipe far, far to the keft to view it."
2393,What a disaster for a writer trying to create a following of readers.
2394,overall Wordpress is a great App except that it Needs a Block button to prevent or eliminate online bullies.
2395,now my only alternative is to block comments or delete my Blog.
2396,already I was forced to delete several Blog Posts because of haters and flamers.
2397,Also I can't change my credit card information on this App.
2398,Nice map interface!
2399,"Works fine, but cumbersome to use, almost impossible to locate addresses and limited capabilities!"
2400,eg.
2401,"the search results did not reflect the known address or city typed in; two US States were downloaded and every address search for the secondary State only gave results in the primary (home) state; responded slowly to Rerouting, resulting to missing a critical turn; a favorite place was identified and stored, but seemed locked and wouldn't open, when selected....."
2402,Love it but where's my schedule?
2403,Update: I still do not have web and app showing the same schedule.
2404,I set up my schedule already online but when I log in to the app it doesn't show any of my selections.
2405,Offline issues Current location is the prime essential to search between two locations for routing.
2406,"So without internet, it cant be ascertained and navigation is not possible at all i guess then and this contradicts the fact  told by you that this app is an offline navigation map."
2407,Please correct me if am wrong.
2408,This app use to be amazing.
2409,"I used it for 2 years while traveling, but now it seems they just don't care."
2410,The app has become so slow to do anything.
2411,Sometimes taking over a minute to even load the search function.
2412,As soon as you resize the map everything disappears and you have to wait another minute for it to come back.
2413,All of this use to be instant.
2414,For an offline map the only thing they seem to be updating is online features like traffic and stuff.
2415,Its basically becoming useless.
2416,Instead of deleting it I have decided to post this review in hopes that they will fix it.
2417,This was once my go-to app for everything.
2418,Now I can't even use it
2419,I realy become upset when I have checked the map of my country.
2420,I am from Azerbaijan and our borders and our independence is recognized by UN and all other international organizations.
2421,"but I don't know why 20% of our lands, The Qarabagh region is showed like a ""Nagorno Qarabagh"" and named it like a independance republic."
2422,May be you don't geography and low then let me explain to you.
2423,You CANNOT put countries which are not recognized by UN in your apps.
2424,I hope this 'mistake' will be corrected!!
2425,!
2426,"The app has a great interface but it lacks some of the feature of its uglier yet more functional peers such as: routing without tolls, moyorways or ferries, indicating the specific lane to select on motorways, graphical selection of the maps to download (you have to know the name of the region!)."
2427,"Until these get added, Maps.me remains a last resort option."
2428,Used to be the best map.
2429,"Great features, easy to use, but it has ONE MAJOR BUG that has been there for 2 years - they sometimes solve it, most of the time they mess it up."
2430,It is a very simple thing : the option to save maps to SD CARD.
2431,"Sometimes an update would relocate your maps to the phone, sometimes it would delete all maps, sometimes you had to uninstall and reinstall, sometimes ...."
2432,"This time they have surpassed it : it moved all my SD CARD maps to memory, filling it right up!!"
2433,And today there is no option to locate maps to SD CARD any more.
2434,2 years and they still can't get this simple but ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL feature to hold.
2435,"So, finally, I'm done and, guess what, in doing so, after trying 8 apps I have found an even better one :  HERE MAPS."
2436,"didnt help one bit, unfortunately."
2437,currently in HK and failed several times locating or navigating to simple destinations about 6-20 min away.
2438,Arrow location is buggy and jumps from street to street.
2439,I like the idea but walking around using this app gets you nowhere.
2440,Citymapper is way more accurate.
2441,i hope this app improves as i like the idea of offline maps
2442,Intrusive popups This app asks to enable GPS like every five seconds even for the operations unrelated to the current location.
2443,Then eventually a modal dialog asking for a play store review will pop up.
2444,"There is no option to permanently disable further requests of that kind, just to ask later."
2445,"This app used to be the best offline map, now it is below usable."
2446,"I would love tolove this app, something to get away from Google, but as much as I try I just cannot work it out."
2447,"I've downloaded offline maps that I can't work out how to find to open, I've tried planning routes from my current location to a nominated destination, no deal, I can't work out how to do that either."
2448,Needs Search option Bookmark set needs search option followed by organize in the marker list.
2449,Cannot search bookmarks placed on the map.
2450,After installing the app it showed my location and the street name was completely wrong.
2451,"I wanted to see what routes it would offer me to my father's village, but a search by the name of the village did not yield any results."
2452,Uninstalled.
2453,Uploading media does not work properly.
2454,Some files do not upload and the app does not resume automatically which is annoying.
2455,But even worse: Some files are uploaded several times if you try to re-upload and then you end up with duplicates.
2456,Also if the app closes in the background it starts uploading all media of a post again.
2457,There is also no source editing.
2458,Recently it just started crashing in the media library.
2459,In summary the media upload is useless.
2460,Good Software before the last update...
2461,Since the latest update you are showing me shops and restaurants that are 10000 miles away from my current location!
2462,So...thank you for the update... Update: My current location was determined by GPS but I had to look on the map for shops and hotels because the search function showed me things on other continents.
2463,"Navigation got better, but still will not use it as a main navigation app for car."
2464,"Please fix: if there are a lot of points in a bookmark set, the list isn't scrolling or scrolling very very slowly"
2465,Edited my rating from 5 stars to 1 star.
2466,I supported the devs by purchasing the app when it first launched.
2467,Very disappointed that they have now inserted ads in search results in the latest update.
2468,I have reverted to version 8.4.9 and will NOT be updating this app anymore.
2469,"Photo uploads disappears in a post When I type something on a post then attaches a photo, then continues typing on the same post, that photo sometimes mysteriously disappears."
2470,It gets kinda frustrating when my post needs several photos and they keep disappearing as I type.
2471,Please fix!
2472,And the new user interface looks like it's opened from a browser.
2473,I think the previous UI looks neater n gives greater convenience.
2474,I feel that the layout now defeats the purpose of a mobile app.
2475,Decent but not very functional!
2476,I find myself having to do everything from my PC rather than here.
2477,The app has no function to edit blog settings like Dashboard and posting on this app leaves a lot to be desired.
2478,It has little to no support for drafting and I cannot insert images and properly edit their positions within the text.
2479,Overall the app needs some major updates.
2480,"Too many problems, posts empty posts, deletes local drafts = garbage app Deletes locally saved posts, posts empty posts, takes forever to upload a few lines of text and a dozen photos."
2481,I will not be using WordPress ever again because of this garbage app.
2482,Worked for a while and then endless problems.
2483,Should be able to access forum from app.
2484,Use an alternative site like blogger or something.
2485,I have lost a lot of hard work and my patience is at an end.
2486,I would give it 0 if I could.
2487,Very poor.
2488,The most ridiculous and non-functional app I've ever seen.
2489,There are so many bags I cannot even name!
2490,"I cannot upload any photo, the scale of new post creation page is over sized that I can't see all the options."
2491,The navigation is enormously vague.
2492,I don't see comments I've made and blogs I follow.
2493,Finally the app crashes all the time.
2494,Well...
2495,The raw job.
2496,It's irritating.
2497,Doesn't work well with plugins Sends a publish event which posts to Twitter even though it's an update to a post and not a new one.
2498,"Web interface works fine, and so did the last version of the app."
