316216,"I love this app. But you're starting to lose me. There are 3 major things wrong. 1)Redundant routes. Mainly on highways, interstates ect. Where the app tells you to exit and get off and then back on the same highway. Super inconvienent. 2)Navigation. Not having street names or #s along with voice nav leaves you guessing. 3)Off road eta. For some reason the algarythm inturprets unpaved roads to take hours to traverse. Misleading the driver with an inaccurate eta. Fix bugs and i edit"
316217,"Such a great app .But ... There's a lot of unnamed places : Buildings or locations , streets , beaches ..etc. (Talking about Morocco. Idk about other countries) And the app always have a bad location to my place . it's always far +200m From my real place. And sometimes when i'm taking a road. The signal doesn't follow . What's make it hard for a Traveler. I Hope u make some new updates to make it the Greatest app."
316218,"Edit 03.09.20: After nearly 10 years of using maps.me, I've finally switched to an open-source (GPL) OSM front-end, which has no ads, no forced updates, no commercial tie-ins, gives more control to the end-user (me!), and offers a richer useful feature set. Bye, and thanks for all the fish ..."
316221,"Voice navigation doesn't work when the phone is locked. The screen must be turned on the whole time, otherwise it won't work. This makes the navigation feature pretty much useless to me. Please fix this, Google Maps voice navigation works fine with the phone in my pocket and Bluetooth headphones connected."
316223,"App is simple and convenient to use. However, I've been getting push notifications in russian, which is terribly annoying, as my phone is configured to use English"
316224,"I originally paid for the full version a few years ago which removed the ads! Having done that I now find they want a further annual payment to remove ads I be already paid to have removed Fair comment from the developer!"
316227,"A wonderful app, that I have enjoyed using immensely, but, after last update, started giving me push notifications in Russian, without any prompt or say on my side."
316232,"With waking mode and tracker on, the system shews just time and does not show the distance or shows it incorrectly (150 m instead of approx 3 km.)"
316237,"Voice doesnt give directions anymore. Thanks for response. Works fine with bluetooth off."
316240,"What happen to this app. Before it was good but now it was horrible. I was lost so many times, and it was always saying wrong turns."
316242,"The roads are old and not updated still using old names and no new buildings and details. The UAE is daily changing but in this app still the same as 2010 Please make the map updated like Google maps"
316243,"It's good app , my problem that I lost all my book marks after reset my mobile and when reinstall the app I lost the old book marks !"
316246,"[EDIT:] Thanks for your reply. Even without GPS, this would still be very useful as a detailed, zoomable map if it could be reliably used offline, as your description implies. But the last time I tried to use it, it refused to run because I had no Net connection. Apparently it wanted to check for a newer version of my map, and wouldn't let me see the one I had. How about relaxing a bit about that, and letting us update when we can?"
316254,"Christ almighty, if I could give 0 stars I would. These guys have been spewing out feature after feature, THAT NO ONE ASKED FOR. You also fixed virtually NOTHING in the way of bugs in the past 3 years. And there are HUNDREDS on GitHub. FIX YOUR GODDAMN BUGS ALREADY!!!!"
316257,"Couldn't hear instructions on my Bluetooth helmet while my android phone was connected... Ruined a bit my experience...."
316269,"Wonderful app, but there is still much to do. Can you add opportunity to create your own guides ? It would be nice to save a bicycle track as a guide. Currently you can import .kml files but firslty you have to create it with the help of another app."
316275,"very very slow download of a 100mb file. a 56k dial up is faster! cant make any route example from a to b bec it need map download but it cant download bec its very slow.! are you kidding me? i haver steady data connection. anything else loads asap. only this app is doing nothing. your respond is a joke!"
316279,"All in all is good for finding some hard to find adress. But as for traffic details, it has no support. There is little button in the options calles Traffic, but when pressed it sais traffic not available."
316282,"I didnt want navigation why does it try to download it Otherwise it has some footpaths and contours,but only every 100m so thats good,and is easy on the eye"
316287,"Cannot move or resequence waypoints, can't save routes and one wrong move and the whole lot is wiped and you have to start again. Very unimpressed."
316290,"Still won't download maps onto my Samsung Galaxy M31... Could it be a Ukrainian location problem ? I have installed a VPN as advised and it takes 5 minutes to download a 69 MB map. That includes it failing 3 times. I would like to give this 5 Stars again."
316292,"Very good maps application, will get 5 stars when you add built in suport to import GPX files and integration with Viewranger."
316303,"why do you not have an updated map always 2016 or 2000 i guess, we have been in our house for 5 years still not on the map"
316309,"Thanks for the response. It works now. It now tells me that traffic detail is not available. Is this an issue with my location or something else?"
316310,"Must have for hikers. Knows all the trails which is brilliant. But UI is quite bad and sometimes bugs out"
316317,"The app is really good but the addresses in it are terrible they are not using a standard way of naming, I have to look for a place in google then find it by searching MANUALLY in maps.me then I can use it"
316320,"If you keep delete negative rating your app won't get better. Maps outdated. Try any other navigation to avoid get lost."
316322,"Attention Bikers: don't install this! Bad route guides to simple places! Not user friendly either!"
316325,"Very complicated : Tried 30 minutes but couldn't find how to navigate to the address..."
316328,"Why I can't view to this app my existing .kml or .kmz files??in my older version of this app,i have been used this app excellently..Why oh why i can't use this app today in my existing .kml or .kmz files?"
316329,"Missing parts of a creek that doesn't have a name. What else is gonna be missing? Who knows? I can't use a map if I can't trust it."
316347,"I installed this app on my mobile, working well. But when I tried to download it on my car screen it doesn't appear on search manue. .. Plz guide me why I can't see it on the list??"
316355,"Huge map sizes that aren't nearly as detailed or accurate as Google maps, waste of time"
316357,"Good application overall, but Abkhazia and South Ossetia are Georgia so no need of them bring separately addressed."
316359,"I need to choose russian language for the app and maps. But the app uses device's settings only."
316361,"Great app. But no traffic updates in india. How do you show indian territory as part of china & pakistan?"
316374,"This app doesn't give me directions to an address, just the street. Some streets are miles long. Useless"
316389,"Mr Bruce must be right if he doesn't know about other free offline maps and navigation applications. But , I agree with the most who have tried this application out of curiosity and think that the concept of this application is good but functionality leaves much to be desired . Uninstalling it and would not want to know if it has been improved in the future !!"
316397,"It will better if it includes editing option"
316402,"Same app as waypoint, cannot plan trip with more than on stop."
316403,"Maps.me shows Georgian region "Abkhazia" and "Shida qartli" occupied by Russia separate from Georgia! Shame!!!"
316407,"Used to be great but now has a very distracting fox icon which cannot be deleted. It wants you to download a guide, even if you don't want to. After dismissing it, the next time the app loads, there it is again. Very poor UI."
316409,"If this wretched thing tells latitude and longitude they've hidden it very well. Lots of pestering about new this and that, layers, would you like to rate us. It's halfway useful when it's not being a bloody pest. Where??? Where do you search for them???"
316411,"Has a lot of maps but takes forever to download relatively small files. Also constantly saying failed download on this app. What should be simple is a pain in the butt. I switched from here maps to this because this app has more countries available, but I feel like Im trading more countries that here maps doesnt have like japan but with a less quality app. I like the maps on here maps better too. Oh well, Ill give it a continued try and see only because ive invested all this time in it so far"
316414,"Please make the app to use Motorways in Pakistan. It simply ignores the motorways and routes through local highways."
316416,"This app makes more connection attempts than probably the next 10 apps combined. Even before doing anything with it, and without running it, it's CONSTANTLY trying to contact Facebook & Google & who knows what else. They blame it on the SDK, but a) it shouldn't be doing it when I haven't even launched the app in forever, and b) other apps aren't nearly as bad. Pretty much every other app shows a handful of attempts, this one goes on for pages. & huge app size for what it is."
316418,"Used to work well on iphone but on android nope"
316427,"I stopped counting the amount of app crashes, the forced detours and missed turnoffs due to the poor setup of this app. You should .never. ever rely on it, but .always. have to verify the routing, else you suddenly end up on a road running parallel to the highway, instead of on it. How often did the app not detect my location and claimed me to be in a building or tunnel?... The one and only reason I still have it installed is that it has been the first running offline... call me sentimental."
316432,"The only use for this app over google is it shows trails and jungle footpaths. After that its 'EFFING USELESS. The pointer spins constantly so you cant tell which way you're facing. It points 180 degrees out and the blue dotted line follows you, ie it can send you back the way you came and not leave your start point blank....so you still think youre going the right way as youre always attached to the dotted line. It should let the pointer move away from the dotted line, then you can see youre off course. If you brush the screen it opens a new dropped pin which then deletes the path you were following. I cant bookmark anything. Theres paths highlighted in red that i didnt add, it constantly directs you to road routes even tho i only want mountain footpaths and have it set to walking. It does work offline for me which is 1 reason not to boot it just yet but its useless to navigate with, i use it just to look for trails. Thankfully im not getting ads cos thailand auto blocks anything that isnt of profit directly to them. You need to disable the info sharing, apparently this app sells info on you 20 times more than other apps"
316433,"Great that you keep on improving. However, I still have to rely with google maps to check map details that are missing."
316435,"Please allow us to sort our bookmarks alphabetically."
316436,"Generally a great map app. Used it in the states without issue. Now it seems, I cant get it to work with Android Auto. Maps.me can you explain what's going on here? Car connects with Android Auto okay, but maps.me does not appear in the list of onscreen apps. Wife's iPhone with Apple car play works fine with app visibility."
316442,"I paid for this app all the way back in 2014, then you made it free, and now you want me to pay again to remove the intrusive ads? You basically ruined a very decent app by adding tons of features no one wants, and now advertising and a horribly overpriced subscription service to remove them..."
316444,"Commenting again in 2020 from 2018 Hi guys! I'm a little bit disapointed for quite long time my request or idea still not included in ur updates.. My request are: Recent tracks will have an option to be permanent. Recent tracks should have an option like a sign that we travel or walk through river, a highway, through a forest, a cave, etc pls consider my idea..i'll change my review to 5 star."
316447,"Rubbish! used to be better than Googlemaps in a lot of instances now whenever I go somewhere new, it wont let me use without downloading a new map!!! In response to the developer, it never used to work that way and I dont know that I'm going to need Maps.me until I'm suddenly in the middle of Ashdown forest looking for walking routes or suddenly lost in a foreign city because Googlemaps is being rubbish"
316452,"Works great except few bugs that blocks the app and freze.if i stay at a redlight more that 3 min it gets stuck.needs improvements to zoom wille driveing or getting close to the turn.....allmost misses the street if you are not paying attention or know the area..sometimes shows that i have allready made thr turn and its confusing becouse i am on the same road and didnt made it....but nice app to use"
316460,"I travel all over the US and having to download a map every single time I need to go somewhere for every city is extremely annoying! Can there not just be one download for an entire country?! UPDATE TO RESPONSE: Still cannot download entire country. Only gives options for 10 states. There are 48 states in the continental US so that is less than helpful."
316462,"I thought this was offline. You have to have internet on to load places and use the map. 😠"
316463,"Very quiet sound and does not muffle music. It is often difficult to hear voice prompts"
316470,"unable to download tbe rest of the philippines. Even just north Luzon. keeps getting the red exclamation icon then just stops downloading. its good but only have metro Manila?? sucks.."
316471,"Full of privacy violations, in other words, another RUSSIAN backed app trying to collect data :) Plus, there are several non-existent countries listed, such as South Ossetia or Abkhazia."
316475,"Im in complete love with it! Sadly for some reason it doesn't support traffic data on my country (argentina) and it makes it very useless sometimes because more than once you will get trapped on traffic while following your route :("
316486,"Is the worst map app I ever tried, it has so little intuition about places I'm trying to look for."
316501,"Not bad. Some things such as speed, speed limit, and driving towards top of screen need to be added."
316504,"It is a real pain in the neck when you are out some place and go to us use it and it goes blank and says down load required. What a pain."
316506,"Postal code cannot detect. Difficult app for navigation.very low mark. Definitely don't use it"
316512,"I don't know why, but there is no more distance and altitude difference in my from-to routes. Only altitude graph. Why?"
316517,"Why maps are not downloading....."
316531,"I love this app but recently it is not straight and the navigation vehicle goes backwards. Can the app owners fix this?"
316533,"Includes approximately 18 different trackers. Is definitely selling your location data. Used for a few months and not again."
316536,"Good for traveling guide"
316538,"Keeps returning to already passed point/stop. Should clearly ask if you want to continue or dismiss."
316540,"Hi bro, I used this app normally after I updated then can not start, when starting app auto disappeared, i tried many times but almost can not open."
316548,"Map of Kathmandu region, Nepal is not downloading. Please fix the issue..."
316556,"Huawei Tablet M5 Lite last update the pointer is shaking and is not stable."
316565,"Horrible app! The privacy violation and data collection that they do to you is horrendous!"
316566,"So bad, not accurate !! it took me to the wrong place, always 300..200m far away from my destination."
316578,"Sometimes frustrating...not intuitive sometimes...but great offline tool"
316580,"Pure junk. Determine a route of travel? Nope. Measure distance between two points? Uh nuh. Use for any kind of navigation? Negatory! Delete and advise potential users about this waste of time? Absolutely!"
316596,"When. ! Open app,!ts auto close whyyyyy"
316597,"Can't find START nor DIRECTIONS and no VOICE for navigation"
316605,"Abkhazia & Tskhinvali region (South Osetia) are Georgia!!! As well as Crimea is territory of Ukraine and annexed by Russia! This maps are incorrect. They spread Putin's political propaganda and offensive to countries that have suffered Russian aggression! Shame!"
316607,"Works well but murders your battery. Enable it and even if not in use, my phone got hot and the battery was drained in no time. It was handy traveling overseas where offline regional maps could be downloaded when wifi was available. Google maps stinks in this respect. However, you must babysit the app to make sure it doesn't raid the cookie jar (your battery) with its extremely heavy pinging of what I guess is the GPS."
316608,"Bangladesh map can't download... stop downloading when 94%"
316610,"Useless app. Can't find a single location I need."
316619,"Stay away from this. Wanted an alternative for Google maps, but I need to use it anyway because this app finds streets but rarely any actual street addresses. The search function is very frustrating and irritating too, with you not able to fill in a long street name and then add the street number to verify this app can't find that place either. Lack of aerial/satellite overlay option a big minus too. Could have been redeemed by bookmarks that can be imported sensibly."
316624,"Totally frustrating that does not support traffic data in Myanmar. It IS a discrimination and racism against innocent people. Not human behavior!!!! Keep that in ur mind we'll never use ur map. And dont show nothing of our country!"
316643,"Please add a speed limit option. In Japan, many people use scooters. 50cc. The max speed limit is 30km/h. So when I search a route using your app, it's always the wrong estimated arrival time. That kinda sucks. Edit: why would I download the updated app if you don't offer what I need. Fix the app and I'll download it. Till then, see you Edit: you offer limited speeds for bicycles and walking. So it's not like it isn't being done. You can and are already doing it. Just add a moped option."
316647,"Why do you need access to my storage, photos etc..? I uninstall it right away.."
316651,"Usable during my travel journey.."
316654,"Completely broken. Won't let you use it without downloading your area, downloads keep failing at 97%, so you literally can't use the app at all."
316661,"This app is great if you need a reliable means of viewing maps offline, but terrible if you intend to use it to seek out pubic transit routes. That's because it only has information on subway networks, and literally zero information on bus networks. Very few cities in North America have subways, and even most Asian countries don't have subways unless you are in their national capital cities. As someone who travels across Asia and doesn't drive, this app doesn't suit my needs."
316668,"Nice map interface! Works fine, but cumbersome to use, almost impossible to locate addresses and limited capabilities! eg. the search results did not reflect the known address or city typed in; two US States were downloaded and every address search for the secondary State only gave results in the primary (home) state; responded slowly to Rerouting, resulting to missing a critical turn; a favorite place was identified and stored, but seemed locked and wouldn't open, when selected....."
316672,"Lots of potential, but for some reason it really, really wants me to download the map of kingston, Ontario. I do not live in kingston, but it wants me to, badly - so much so that it will bar me from using the app until ive done so. It is also not content with having me download the map only once, it insits that i doanload the map every time i want to use the map. I only use this app to look at civoc addresses for my courier job. I guess i need to move to kingston."
316673,"Map downloading is a nightmare. Incredibly slow and clunky, updates are even worse because instead of replacing the old maps it downloads to a new file, taking double the space. App in general is very slow and nonintuitive. Nags for location spy mode (sorry, "high accuracy" mode is much less accurate than "device only", it just lets Google more comprehensively compromise your privacy)."
316676,"Mail ru making worse any project which they bought. Map can not display even the sea near Vietnam"
316677,"access for storage and data... nah"
316679,"I like app, but one disadvantage. Big internet traffic using. For 20 minutes I've driven 9 km and app ate more 10 Mb. I think its too much."
316682,"Not able to download maps."
316683,"The app keeps crashing every time I try to use it. Tried reinstalling and followed the offical maps.me troubleshoot instruction step by step, but nothing helped."
316685,"It worked flawlessly for years, now it seems broken. One day it zoomed out to max and crashed when i tried to zoom in. Tried updating then tried reinstalling, and won't install. Now tried emptying phone space, still no. So sad as it's pretty much an essential app for me. Any help possible?"
316686,"Loved this app for years until Version 9.5.2. Now it crashes every time I try to create a bookmark. (Samsung S7)"
316691,"i love this map for hiking and offline information. however i have used it for navigation with my motor vehicle and it can rarely find the place im looking for, so i have to search then input the whole address. i may try again as ive banned all google's nosy prying apps including their maps. if i retry maps.me I'll post an update."
316692,"Used to be a decent application. Now it takes a very long time to render the map, even though it is downloaded. Virtually unusable. Uninstalled."
316693,"Keep crash while connected to my wifi pls. Help"
316706,"Would be a 5 star if it was possible to search through my bookmarks list to find a place. I have a list of over 16,000 locations throughout the country, only about 200 of which I use. It would be great if I could search for the places I need. I am using the Android version on my Samsung S20"
316707,"1. It doesn't show routes like bus lines 2. Has wrong information on Georgia. Abkhazia and South Osetia are part of Georgia and must not be separate on map"
316711,"Wont work, you will click on the link for the address and the app will only load up to the home screen. You will type in the address and it wont activate guide."
316720,"This app is cool and all and gets the job done. But (and it's a big but) you really really need to make sure mobile data doesn't get wasted updating maps. I guess an auto download started over Wi-Fi but of course didn't finish when I closed the app. I discovered that the app kept trying to resume updating my maps upon each opening - when I was on mobile data and not Wi-Fi. As a result I have turned off automatic map updating. There should be an option to auto update over Wi-Fi only!"
316722,"CONS: - I paid for the app way back when you had to purchase it. Some time later they made the app free but filled with ads, and now you have to buy subscription to remove the ads. This is the primary reason for 1 star rating. - Car navigation is so bad it's practically useless  PROS: - Good offline map support for when you visit countries where you have no service so long as you do not need navigation - Maps include hiking trails which is very useful if you're hiking national parks and you want to check where you are on the trail. The hiking trail maps are actually better than Google's."
316725,"It is a good app, easy to download map and user friendly but it need to download frequently as in sometime GPS won't work. I couldn't find the problem behind the problem occuring in GPS ."
316728,"The app is not bad in fact. But it keeps on sending spam right to the notification bar. Hence only 3 stars.  And, yes, I know how to disable the notifications. But seriously, adding a function that the users have to go and actively disable is exactly an approach that deserves 3 stars.  Spamming is a sign of disrespect for the users."
316732,"Easy and convenient"
316733,"I want to love this app, but can't. Searching has too many problems: locations don't return results, and switching between map/list view makes some entries disappear. I love the spirit of this app, but without reliable search, I cant use it. UPDATE: I worked with support for 3 separate bugs. They were pleasant and prompt, but 2 of the issues remain, and they are deal-breakers for me. I genuinely look forward to using this app in a year or two when its more reliable."
316735,"I have been using this app for several years. It was very good but has become less reliable as time has passed. I was beginning to think it was my phone developing a problem but I know have a new one and there are still fundamental issues. It can't find my home street or several major roads in London ( eg Holloway Road, Oxford Street) and regularly fails to get a route due to application errors, dumping me off the coast of Africa. Tried deleting and reloading but no better. Time to try other apps"
316741,"I used to love this app. Now you can no longer download a whole state, you have to download everything in pieces. And there is no map showing you where one piece begins and the other ends. Who asked for this?? Nobody did."
316743,"Awful. it'll never give you the information you need. Stick with Google Maps. You can Download maps offline on Google too. I tried finding the public transport options from one city to the next (takes about one hour) but your app said "This route is too far for pedestrians to walk", 1, i wasn't asking for walking directions and 2, who are you to say what's too far. People have walked around the earth."
316744,"There are 2 key problems with this app for remote or offline use. Firstly, one has to zoom in a long way to see remote roads and tracks. The issue with this is one doesn't know in many cases if there is a track there to be zoomed in on, and if one is exploring a large area, it is impractical and very annoying to have to zoom in and out all the time. For this reason alone, for offline use, it deserves a 1, but not a star Secondly, I don't see a convenient Goto function, or a GoBack function, etc"
316746,"This is very detailed map, great job for that, I give you that. But there are some things that's annoys me, like: 1. You start release map updates together with app updates, so you can't update just maps. (OK you told me I can go to your website and download just maps and put it in folder. Not big problem, but stil...) 2. Expected arrival time, now is way off then before. In much older versions, like 6.5.4., EAT was much better. And yes, I already contacted about that with examples, and you still didn't fix that. 3. I would love to see options like: avoid highways and to have options for alternative routes. Yes, you add, add stop option, but this things would be much better. Hope you will consider all this things."
316749,"this map dont expect to put in a starting point and a destination just that easy and have it give you anything. no its getting info from you, not you from it! so if you dont mind spending your time building up there map base to eventually be sold back to users at some premium than have at it. i just want directions now thank you or you can pay me something and i will let you fill in some blanks?"
316750,"I used to have this app (paid for) but I stopped using it (don't recall why). I have just installed it again and it is asking me to pay. I decided to use the free version meantime. I added a route from the town centre shopping to my home by public transport to be told that it is too far to walk (4 miles). "The pedestrian route is too long". When I pick the walking directions it gives me a good route. There are several buses that cover this route. Not impressed. Uninstalled"
316751,"Hate the way when in press the bookmark star, a page pops up covering 3/4 of the map, now using Android. On ios, I used to be able to do a sherch, then star everything that came up fast eg a brown star for historic sites, a blue star for toilets, red for supermarkets etc, I would do this before arriving in a new place, but now it a compleat hassle. Otherwise a great app. Your reply was of no help. Its better if the page only pops up WHEN I WANT IT TO! SO VERY FUSTRATING! Now need a new App."
316752,"Over-all, the program seems OK but the voice is WAY too fast. I feel like I'm listening to the voice-over disclaimer for a car commercial when the directions sound like "turnrightandthenturnright."  Also it seems to have issues finding addresses. I have tried several addresses that I KNOW exist but it can't find them. If I put in "108 East Main Street" it finds no matches. If I put in JUST "East Main Street", it finds the street that I'm looking for but, of course, it can be several blocks from the address I need. And it doesn't realize that "E Main St" should be the same as "East Main Street" or "E Main Street", etc. I.e. if I don't spell out "East" and "Street", it won't find it at all. And this is an "Editor's Choice" app?????"
316754,"The app leaks personally identifiable data to Facebook, without permission or knowlegde from the user and without any Facebook login. The developer claims that they have to use the Facebook SDK therefore they have no choice over leaking the data."
316755,"I generally like the App, specially it's offline functionality, which was really helpful a few months ago in Cuba.  One thing that annoys me, is the fact that the navigation instructions only work when the screen is on, which makes it unpractical and dangerous to use while riding a bike. I would love to see that issue addressed in a future update"
316756,"Gets you where you want to be, however no means of selecting an alternative route, plus no speed warnings. A good basic navigation tool if you simple want to get from A to B."
316761,"I downloaded the app to solve my offline gps in west virginia. I completed the settings very specifically to ensure accuracy and fairness to the app. once the upload was completed, the map had cities located in wrong state, the timing was correct, but the gps took me too another state and two states away where I was not going. my time is valuable like anyone else. I hate wasting time. keep away from this app."
316762,"This app used to be great! Now it just crawls! I'm trying to plan a trip with various stops & I can't even get it started. I want to throw my device across the room! Very sorry it has gotten so unusable. EDIT. Finally the speed picked up, yet it tells me there is no way to get to certain towns where the road is clearly marked and Google Maps has no issue. They take no responsibility for routes not working because they are using some other company's maps. Removed."
316764,"It's all around good, but the route calculating algorithm is not good. It tends to choose the longer route than other GPS apps and the only way to chose an alternative route is to manually add stops. Searching is also a hassle as the results are usually street names that use any single word you type from closest to farthest. (For example, typing "Sebago Lake State Park" brings up all the "State Route"s.) Not good when you wanna trek out to another state."
316765,"I was testing this out to use offline so I downloaded all of the US maps. My first test was to drive to a park that I know really well. The app took me on unpaved gated roads and even over a footbridge. Garmin and CoPilot both got it right. I then went to a different app on my phone and when I came back Maps.me was hung. Haven't been able to restart it since. Too bad, the maps look nice and detailed."
316768,"Has some UI usability issues. While doing a search on a street, it's very unresponsive when I press on the street that has already come up in the search results.  Also, no way to enter a street number. Which seems pretty basic and shocking that it doesn't allow user to specify a street number!   Disappointing. I just spent 20 minutes trying to enter in the address of a location.   Suggest you hire some UI designers and product managers to do a better job redesigning this app, to be user friendly and make it easy for users to do simple things, like actually entering in an address!  In response to Developer's "fixing" the 2 missing EXAMPLE addresses I listed, that's like a drop  in the ocean. The problem is NOT simply that it couldn't locate the 2 EXAMPLE addresses I listed. The problem is deeper. It was unable to properly locate an arbitrary, VALID, address. This is something Google Maps can do EASILY.   Based on this rather GLARING defect, I think this largely makes this app unusable for general purpose navigation.."
316769,"I wanted to like this app. I'm looking for an alternative to google maps. The routing is actually ok, although the estimated timings don't take traffic conditions into account. The offline operation is good, but there isn't really an 'online' mode. If I currently have a good connection I want to be able to search a new area without having to download the section first. But what has killed it for me is that the search is useless. There us no UK postcode search, which is what I primarily use. Searching by street name sometimes works, but often comes up empty. Conversely when there are multiple matches adding extra location details (borough, etc) doesn't narrow the search effectively. As far as i can tell it treats each term entered separately and at some point if you haven't chosen one of the matches for your first term and keep typing it switches to searching on the second term, ignoring the first. I only managed to experience the navigation by finding places on Google maps, and then matching the street pattern and zooming to find them manually in this. I gather it works better in some countries than others, so I'll probably try it again sometime, but for now I'm giving up."
316770,"Interface and concept are quite good. Navigation is as mediocre as every OSM-based navigation app, but certainly not bad. Also I miss some convenience features like showing parking lots near my destination listed in ascending distance to my destination. But what really pisses me off though, is that there is just simply no (obvious?) way to get rid of those annoying ads! I would happily pay to have them removed, but I just can't!? I'd give more stars if you let me disable ads."
316775,"This app used to be perfect and previously helped me navigate around the world, but after updates these last few months, the app will no longer work offline. Unless I am connected to wifi, the app hangs on the preloading screen logo. Consequently, the app is now useless to me. If I wanted an app that required data and pressured me to to turn on location services, I would use Google Maps. This is disappointing because this used to be my go-to app."
316776,"USED to be great !... now it's too complex.. it auto updates unwanted aspects you have no control over ...you can't stop it... and so now I feel that it's invasive on my privacy ...I don't trust it anymore I'm strongly considering uninstalling it. once again , someone took something that worked , made it "better" and ruined it ! it's like some unspoken law!!!"
316777,"Poor slow UI, abuses privacy, spams notifications, requires a cloud service before it will save favourites and nags until you do this. The routes are awful. Changing or redoing a route is cumbersome and slow, and if I go off route because I know a better one it doesn't attempt a route from where I am, it just updates to get me back into its original route. It also doesn't know the difference between even a slight bend and a turn so is never silent."
316782,"The ads have become very intrusive. An important part of the screen has the ad and it is difficult to select a map function without hitting the ad. It isn't worth it anymore.  Trip planning is an exercise in patience.It is repeatedly suggested that I download my current location not the country map I am trying to work with for a vacation.  Everything is a charge! The UI is not very intuitive and trying to select a route between 2 bookmarked locations - well - I still haven't figured that out!  Really - Google Editor Choice? Methinks not!"
316784,"Why no compass in navigation mode? So confusing when arrow points not the same direction phone is turned to. Used to be good, now I am looking for an alternative. Response: arrow not rotating after building a route often makes it difficult and slow to figure out which direction to go at the start of the journey. When arrow is rotated by compass it's easy - looking at the map you know at once and exactly which direction you are facing. Please don't turn off compass after the route is built!"
316786,"This was the greatest app, but I noticed recently that it is running all the time and requesting my location. It is the only app that when unused and closed fully still restarts itself. It handles like a virus and is impossible to stop. I have tried every method of disabling it when not in use but cannot stop it. The only option to prevent the spying is to uninstall."
316787,"I've used this steadily for almost 4 years on bike trips all over the world. Three to six months at a time. It's been great. I'm downgrading my review. With the changes they made to the new file system they also made it impossible to manage saved routes and bookmarks. Now called lists there is no method to manage them heirarchially. I'm looking to switch to ridewithgps."
316788,"Second downgrade by me: today I discovered that I can't store maps on external SD-card, so nearly 4GB of maps.me data is using up my phone's storage. By now most attraction POIs have disappeared in favour of more hotels & restaurants. :( So today the app gets uninstalled. Good bye! Tip: if you want to uninstall maps.me you have to remove all maps from within the app first! Otherwise they don't get uninstalled and clog up your storage."
316792,"Nice concept, needs improvement. Downloaded it so I can use it when I'm in roaming, sadly had to go online using other apps. When I want to see which bus to take from point A to point B, I always get "pedestrian route too long" even tho I never chose the walking option. Navigation is also glitched and not loading properly even tho I have a good signal."
316798,"Please fire all staff involved in recent updates and get back to working app. I used to love it, the best one ...BUT now constantly crashing, measuring distance between two places doesn't work as it wants to download extra maps and never finishes. Constantly updating large quantity of data on maps (completely unnecessary). How can you put adverts or ask for yearly fee on app, thats gone totaly down the hill??"
316802,"Excellent maps (thanks OpenStreetMap), crappy SatNav. I'm looking for a good offline maps app to use in my car, and based on the reviews and how the maps and routing looks on this, I thought I'd found my answer, big "but" incoming: I don't know if this is the same for everyone, but the app won't seem to recognise any street numbers, so any address I type will only find the street. Some streets are massive! this isn't useful. Also quite often after searching and finding a generic town/street, I try to "route to" it and then get an error saying the app can't give directions to this location, try and be more precise. So yeah, not really any use."
316804,"The best maps in terms of details, but two things are so irritating that they ruin everything for me : 1) it takes very long to create a route, 30 seconds and more for a straightforward route is normal 2) when searching for a location and the point is shown on the map and you decide to zoom out/in to have a better view of the area, the point disappears and you have to search again to get back to the location."
316805,"Excellent for guides, offline use and finding locals points of interests.  The major downside is lack of currency.  In my local area alone, it's missing more than half of the restaurants, shops, and gas stations that have opened in the last 1 - 3 years.  Contrast to Google Map and nothing is missing including a recently opened restaurant."
316807,"Great app to use for getting walking directions. Even driving to places with a car worked quite well. Though for both, walking and driving, the app frequently made mistakes in getting the correct position. Sometimes the proposed paths also partly weren't making sense (e.g. leaving a highway to take a parallel dirt road for 100m). Otherwise helpful, even includes many points of interest and stone accommodation."
316809,"Change their business model to a subscription. I purchased this app for all my devices Android and iOS. At the time there where no additional fees, ads or subscriptions. Now this app has ads and to get rid of them you have to pay a monthly subscription. They changed the rules in the middle of the game, I'm deleting it from all my devices. This app works offline after you download maps. Searching for an address is not good. You can import KMZ files, such as places you've mark in Goolge Maps."
316810,"It was a very confusing app in my opinion. What was even worse is how when cycling or walking the map didn't update probably according to my location and had a huge delay which resulted in me having to check where I was the whole time and find out the route myself. There also wasn't a very easy location saving system. It was nice that special things like Cafe's and hotels were visual on the map though."
316811,"great for hiking or mountain biking, you can load your own tracks as KMZ. horrible for driving. no routing options. EDIT: By routing options, I mean selecting types of road you wish to use / avoid. Option to select fastest / shortest route. I've been led numerous times to backroads or no roads, because Maps.Me figured that is the shortest route."
316813,"I've relied on maps.me for a long time as an offline backup to google maps and it has served me well. Sadly the current iteration has push notifications with no obvious setting to disable. While I can disable all notifications from the app at the system level this does not bode well for the direction of this apps development. I will be searching for an alternative."
316814,"It's ok. It can be frustrating to use. The directional arrow sometimes keeps turning round and round and then points to the wrong direction. Nov. 2019: I just did the maps.me update--the search function doesn't work the same way it used to before the update. I used to be able to put the number of the house or building, then the street, city, state, and the app would locate the address. That doesn't work anymore."
316816,"Pretty good app. It's great to be able to download offline maps. Searching for a store or address works well. Unfortunately you can't sort the results by distance so it takes a minute to find a store near you. Otherwise it works well. I will try again at some point. Perhaps the sort option will be added."
316817,"Frustrating and great. Frustrating: Does not inform me of turns soon enough. I expect to know immediately after I make a turn what is next (coming from google/here maps which do this). Not knowing when you check for the next turn makes me check the app too often which is dangerous. Great: Fast, availability to quickly adding places to open street maps, availability to download small parts of map. FYI: I don't use voice as I am on a motorcycle ."
316819,"After downloading the map for the city closest to where I live, I was able to see the streets around me on the map, but my address searches only pulled up streets in the large city, not my town, even though I specified the town name. While driving, it regularly covered my location icon with the name of a street. Not useful if I can't see where I am and I can't see where I'm going."
316820,"have to download small areas of one country one at a time to get routes. for example I tried to get route from Finland to U.K. but I works have to go all the countries along possible routes to get directions. You should add full area map downloads to be easier like Europe, north America, central and south America, Africa and Asia could be made in two ţo five sections of download considering the area of those places and how large the areas are. other than that the app is great."
316824,"Plus: -detailed maps -no inaccuracies in the map material found Cons: -localisation doesn't work properly (when not connected to a wifi network, which typically is the case on the road): it takes very long before it finds a location at all, and in the end the result can still be 500 m wrong. (with other apps (here and google maps) it does work, so it's not the hardware). Minor remark: I personally prefer the old look of the bookmark pins."
316827,"I have yet to actually use this app in an offline map setting. I like the way it works so far though. Two complaints: 1) I paid for a premium version of this app over a year ago so I would not have to deal with ads and now I have to pay to remove the ads and 2) after this most recent update I am having issues looking at the guides. I am using an Android Motorola Z2 force."
316831,"Very useful, but has its problems. (1) the location often does not work, even with full bars in the middle of the city. (2) search results are sometimes very bizarre... If I search for a simple city name like Hanover, it gives me a town somewhere in the US like 100,000 kms away when im reality I'm in Canada and the city is like 10km away. Both issues appeared on 2 different androids tested (android 6 and android 10)."
316833,"Nice app, works well. Suggestion to developer: when finding routes, it will be great if several route options will be provided such that users can make choices which route to take. Even if the other routes is not the fastest, sometimes the fastest route is not always the best route. May be option also to not use or avoid tollways can be a good addition. Thanks."
316839,"Search can not find basic places such as "Trenton, New Jersey" or "New York City, NY". When you finally get a start and end point loaded, it doesn't provide directions (ie: "Drive north on I-25 for 23 miles. Take exit 123 for Route 66 east") - it only seems to function in turn-by-turn navigation mode requiring the GPS to be on."
316842,"Petty poor at finding addresses. I can input a street name and it gives distances to each street by that name in the entire city, which is fine, if you know the distance of the street that you want. I can input a suburb and it will find the suburb, however if I want to input the street and the suburb simultaneously, it tells me that it can't find the location. As for inputting a street number, forget it. Maybe I'm doing something wrong but I seem to be able to use all the other GPS apps. Uninstal"
316843,"Horrible search capabilities. When inputting for example Kingston Rd. It won't find anything unless you spell out in "Kingston Road". Also when searching for closest restaurant it doesn't show all options on the map. Instead you have to pick from a list! Really frustrating. Also lost my saved bookmarks of Trinidad locations. Hoping it was saved to another Google account but I don't see an option to select from alternate account to check."
316844,"I paid for the add free program in 2014 as I do alot of traveling where I have to be offline and in the past 2 years have now been billed for an "annual subscription" to remove the adds - which I did not consent too. It also lost all my bookmarks from an overseas trip. Do yourself a favor and find an alternative offline app."
316845,"Just started using this app. Maps are great but I am unable to download any guides, maybe the server is down? Turn by turn directions are great but the app stops tracking movement when the screen is turned off to save battery. It would be great if it continued to track movement when the screen was off and also if the screen turned back on for a short while when approaching a turn. Maybe in the next update?"
316850,"This app actually gets you lost more than it helps navigate to a particular location. It's laggy, shows you in totally wrong locations, freezes and orientation is all messed up... And yes, I have calibrated my compass. By the time it catches up you realise that you have walked 500m in the wrong direction. Useless."
316851,"i was liking for a place outside of my area, i searched for it but the app couldn't figure it out past my location. i don't leave bad reviews ever! but this app sucks. so does Google maps because they don't know what an update is. if you want to see if a location has changed find someone with an iphone. it's the only thing they're good for."
316853,"Frustrated that Google Maps only shows restaurants nearby. This appears to have the same distance limit in restaurant searches- it only shows restaurants as far out as a mile or so. There was also a text box advertising it's subscription service that loaded on open. Google maps has offline maps and a Share feature. This is, as far as I can tell, the exact same material I get using the free app that I wanted this to replace."
316857,"Can you please explain why this app needs storage permission? Don't tell me that you need storage space to save offline maps. I'm a developer and I know that's not what this permission is for. An Android app can read and write its own storage space perfectly well without asking for any permissions. The storage permission this app asks for gives it access to all the files on a device."
316859,"used to be great, travelled all sorts of countries on it offline. now it doesnt take in most addresses if it isnt online, full of ads. the recommendations are kinda flimsy and not as well integrated as google. The city guides are intwresting that they cover less travelled cities.....a great app that has only gone down hill."
316860,"The free version is fine. It contains info on small alleys, which is helpful, although GPS gets lost sometimes (not sure if it's the app fault). However, I would strongly discourage to buy the paid version of the app. The "PRO" maps have just wikipedia info, and they have mistakes (unexisting places, erroneous descriptions...). Really useless, and there's no option for refunds once you pay and discover these not so PRO features."
316862,"the map was good but there is still some bugs as of now from this day i commented, i installed it and downloaded the map from my place and i give it a try,, when i tried it,it took me to a lot of dead end route,,like when i was going to a food chain from my place,,it wants me to take the route but in front of me is a wall but it says i need to go through,"
316865,"Downloaded as it is supposed to support offline walking directions but it is rubbish. slow to load and the search can't find a metro station as a starting point to walk from, not that was a big deal as it couldn't find the destination so I guess a starting point is irrelevant. deleted I'll go back ti Google maps and use them offline even thoughbit doesn't give walking directions but at least Maps can find the start and end"
316866,"I'm trying this since I can download (apparently) non-expiring maps, unlike Google Maps. Comparing downloaded maps to live Google Maps isn't a fair comparison, but I'll do it anyway: Google has better audio and visual navigation (maps.me cuts off end of audio), more complete maps (Some Pl. vs. Some St. appears on Google but not maps.me), and a less buggy GUI (maps.me delays GPS updates 10-15 seconds sometimes, while Google is real-time)."
316868,"Well I used to be very happy with this app and got the pro version back in 2013. I am now getting loads of adverts and options to pay again to remove them. I email the developer and was basically told that the app went free 5 years ago and that I had had my monies worth! So therefore I need to pay again to remove adverts. So much for customer loyalty and all the people I have recommended this app to. I won't be any more."
316869,"From great to ok When I bought the app it was one of the only offline maps available and it did a pretty good job of it. These days it's getting more bogged down by unnecessary features, has ads (despite me having bought it), and can' t even sync bookmarks properly (just lost all bookmarks on one device as they were overwritten by those from another - nobody in the team hear of merge??) It's still the only decent offline mapping tool though so it stays installed.."
316870,"I'm an engineer and couldn't get this app to work on two phones, J7 Prime and S8+. First I downloaded all Massachusetts maps but search couldn't locate my home or work address (but I can find them on openstreetmaps). So then I downloaded all US maps...still couldn't find any addresses I wanted in Boston, a pretty big city. UNINSTALL!!!"
316871,"Worse than useless. Won't find anything near me. Tried again today with the post office. It found several. none were the one within 5 miles from me. I tried to put in the street address , and before I could get to the street name it told me "oops, no results found" Asked google assistant to take me to the closest post office and it did without any additional interaction."
316873,"I only give 3 stars so far 1 because it is new but it sort of works, 2 because it loaded and found my SD card, 3 because the maps are fairly accurate. Sadly we would not use this in any area we are not familiar with as the routing seems to be freeway dependant, not good if there is any reason to leave the freeway and the map for Lacey WA must be 15 years old example being I5 North bound to Slater Kinnney has not allowed left hand turns on the first exit for years! Now I will keep using this app"
316877,"Not showing full details of any area. Only shows no guide found here."
316879,"great app but don't understand why when trying to go from Namibia to botswana through the caprivi strip, from Ngepi camp to kasane town it takes me through Maun. A trip which should be 300 odd klms is 1200 odd klms. there are a number of errors in your Namibia routes that we have noticed and have hence resorted to other gps. I have a snapshot of the route if it helps."
316884,"Overall usefull for navigating, especially metros. The search function is pretty weak, it does not pull up places even though they are listed on the map. I will keep using the app, but something I hope they fix is the map recentering on the last geo location in offline mode/no signal. Its pretty annoying if everytime you open the app you lose sight of your location because your last phone detected location is in a different town or even country."
316889,"I use the app since 5y while being on the road. The maps are awesome and are showing most of the time even small bush tracks. The search for location names is annoying from time 2 time as you see it on the map when you zoom in but can't search for it. The voice guide is not accurate too often and that's the main reason for 3 stars. Not able to say the correct exit in plenty of roundabouts, slight left/right on straigth roads or on 180degrees corners or in roundabouts when to go straight"
316890,"Good but don't understand why the app is showing red notificatons so often. It is a mystery how to respond."
316891,"didnt help one bit, unfortunately. currently in HK and failed several times locating or navigating to simple destinations about 6-20 min away. Arrow location is buggy and jumps from street to street. I like the idea but walking around using this app gets you nowhere. Citymapper is way more accurate. i hope this app improves as i like the idea of offline maps"
316894,"It's best offline map but it could be much better if it could locate in houses and buildings. Without this feature, it becomes more difficult to trace out when needed urgent. Besides, it also can't trace the locations and routes on the road many times. Hope this problem gets solved soon. Thanks."
316897,"This app is pretty good with what it's supposed to do though I don't understand why would it divert from a straight road from point A - B. Goes to the side streets when you it clearly has no reason to do so. I can't find anything in the settings to stop it. Maybe a new update would be good that allows you to choose a quick way or fuel efficient. I use a Nokia 6 (2017)."
316898,"I would love tolove this app, something to get away from Google, but as much as I try I just cannot work it out. I've downloaded offline maps that I can't work out how to find to open, I've tried planning routes from my current location to a nominated destination, no deal, I can't work out how to do that either."
316900,"This used to be my No1 app, but since lately it does not function at all. I have erased it several times but installed again hoping it to be its former quality but its not. When you move it cant follow. The voice is now just horrible. And app shows non existant exists etc. I am a bit confused since I have used it before and it has been realky detailed. But now it just takes space on the phone"
316901,"I wish this was better, then I could delete Google. This doesn't show alternative routes. The search isn't great either, it often doesn't show places that come up straight away on the devil's Google Maps - I can often find roads, but when I type in a number on the road it doesn't show it. :("
316902,"This app is definitely handy when you have no wifi available while traveling. However, I've found that it can be super hit and miss. This one time in Albania we were driving on the highway and the map decided to steer us down a dirt road, which turned out to be a tractor trail through a cornfield with massive potholes. Obviously our tiny Chevy Spark couldnt handle these off roading requirements and we got stuck in the mud. Luckily the locals are nice af and helped us out. Looking more closely, the tractor trail was saving us a whopping 3 minutes to meet back up on the same highway."
316904,"The maps are excellent and overall the app works well. App gets 3 stars because the directions feature is virtually unusable. Public transport directions suggested walking 2,6 km to a train station when there is a tram stop 400 m from my location - with no option to select another route. Cycling directions are equally inflexible, with suggestions rarely being the best route and with no options for alternate routes. Still needs a lot of work."
316905,"I was disappointed that you can't just input a postal code for a location, which can be easier and more sure way than to pick out of a list of similar names in different locations (less chance of error). I did like that you can choose among different methods of travel, including by bike, although it grossly over-estimates required time by about half, or by a third when compared to Google maps."
316908,"App only for big cities like london, delhi etc. Mostly lines only available without name. Shown Only one navigation route, though many alternate available. Pros 1. Less data and less battery usage 2. Big cites data available 3. Make our own bookmarks, location etc Cons. 1. Complete map data available only for large cites. 2. Suburban, minor cites name only included If your moblie has enough space, google offline is better. Not suitable for travellers through small cities villages etc."
316910,"it used to be good, unfortunately, recently, I found that it would not work; neither finding location nor giving correct route. Problem with location continues. Unfortunately, it's becoming use less; unable to detect location so it keeps trying with out any result. Meanwhile, other similar applications work finely."
316911,"As other reviewers have mentioned, you can't search by address. For example, if your want directions to 12335 Fake St, the app will refuse. It will only let you plot a route to Fake St. If Fake St is more than a few blocks long, that's a huge problem. Also, you can't even search for an address until you download that region's maps. If you want to drive from NYC to LA, you have to download every map along the way before you go. Problem is, most maps are named after smaller towns, not big cities."
316912,"positive: - search function is fast - house numbers are building shape are really accurate - download of maps only if needed negative: - strange routing algorithm (it's fast but not so good). example: from Ingolstadt to Stuttgart almost no Highways are used. it recommends to go via Nördlingen (takes 20 minutes longer than using A8 via Augsburg). - some oneway streets are marked wrong. edit: I installed the last version (9.1.8) and still the route between IN and Stuttgart without A8."
316915,"Installed, opened, app immediately contacted facebook, multiple phone home sites, and more. To the devs, I don't mind paying to remove ads. But if I do, NEVER EVER EVER phone home, and ever contact evil facebook. Yet before I can even attempt to pay, you're contacting everyone on the planet with info about me, my phone, etc. Uninstalled."
316916,"I also agree that the app does not work as it used to. Previously you would enter the street number, name and town and it would come up but it now just gives multiple options none of them what you want nor does not give any reference to the town other than the main capital city which means you have to enter everyone until the correct one is found. It used to be a very good app and I used it constantly overseas but now I cannot as I cannot trust it will get me to where I need to go. I tried the OpenStreetMap you mentioned in the previous post and it gives me no option to tell anyone nor does it bring up the requested address."
316918,"I paid for this and now it's free. Typical bait and switch. Now they want me to pay for in-app unlockables. This is literally a crime. How dare you put ads in an app I paid for and features I paid for behind another pay wall! I paid for a lifetime ad-free license. At least give us a code for removing ads in the app you thieves! "We need ads to stay afloat" what garbage, 50 million plus downloads. I don't want to hear excuses! I'm contacting Google."
316921,"Great app and has offline maps but isn't able to locate when offline."
316922,"After installing the app it showed my location and the street name was completely wrong. I wanted to see what routes it would offer me to my father's village, but a search by the name of the village did not yield any results. Uninstalled."
316924,"Has trouble finding various places, like often needing to manually type out California instead of CA (search needs to be more intuitive). Slow to trace routes over ~500 miles, compared to my outmoded but consistent 2005 Garmin. Reading about inaccurate user entries in OSM makes me wonder if open source maps are another Libertarian dream. I would rather have a strict regulatory system in charge of important destinations. Look up map vandalism, lack of oversight, etc. But free is OK!"
316925,"It's a good app, sure, but it just can't top Google maps. I want to be able to enter precise addresses, i.e. house numbers, and it rarely if ever manages to find them. Public transport routing is also worse, only calculating one and not giving you several choices like Google."
316926,"I do like the feature of offline maps and being able to put down multiple locations pins to save specific locations, however I am not able to even look up specific locations... When I type in the complete address for a house, the map only shows how to get to the entire street, which some roads can be very lengthy, and not to the specific house."
316931,"So inaccurate and unreliable! It was the cause of MUCH frustration when walking in Barcelona and Seville. It seems to perform better in cities laid out on a clear grid but beyond that, it's pretty useless. I absolutely would NOT use this app for driving navigation. To be specific, the location arrow is very slow to respond and it often indicates the opposite direction of actual travel. Next, t here seems to be a 'sweet spot' for reading the street signs when zooming in to pinpoint location."
316934,"When I downloaded the map, I encountered a huge mistake. The mistake is to show Karabakh independently, which means that the borders of the independent Azerbaijani territories recognized by the United Nations are ignored. That's why I delete this program that gives false information and I do not recommend it to anyone. If the error is not corrected as soon as possible, I will apply to the court under national law that collects signatures."
316938,"Lately the voice that guides is not in sync with the indications on the map. Often the voice is too much ahead in comparisson with the guidance on the map. For example it tells you to turn but on the map the turn is later passing maybe 1 or 2 side streets, if you'd listen to the instructions of the voice you'd have turned too early into the wrong street."
316942,"I installed this app in the hope of avoiding google maps. In favour: map quality is excellent. Bookmarking places isn't very intuitive, but the real failure is lack of routing understanding. In the UK an app like this should have settings that create *sensible* route choices; nothing I found stopped it trying to send me from Wiltshire to Kent via central London. On paper the route looks ok; in the real world it involves a congestion charge and would take forever (subjectively). More work needed."
316943,"This used to be my absolute favorite app! Used it daily. I have over 100 pins and don't want to loose them. But ever since update came out about a year ago, I can no longer get in. Any map I use wants to first download an update but it will not download. Just spins and spins. Help! I really miss maps w me!!😎"
316946,"I used to love this simple, lightweight app for offline navigation purposes. However it has become incredibly obtrusive in recent months, constantly asking for reviews of locations I may or may not have been. In that way, it has become many of the things I disliked about Google Maps."
316947,"Weird. I live in Colorado, it doesn't let to download new places even though they exist. If the place you want to go to is not recognized, the app shows you a cartoon fox... With a shoe... Probably, it means something deep, but it would be easier to say 'sorry, can't find it'. And again, why not? Even with an internet it's impossible to create a route. Also, all fancy features 'photo spots', 'nightlife' etc. work only for a very limited list of random cities. Didn't find it helpful or reliable."
316948,"This map always frustrated me, because it could rarely find what I was looking for, even when I could get it to acknowledge that there was even a town. My requests for guidance in searching was met by email saying I should join in adding things to the map. I tolerated this cause it was free, offline, and good enough. I am Not.Interested in something this suboptimal that wants money to clear away afs that are placed IN THE WAY. Uninstalling."
316950,"Navigation app does not work on expressways in japan. For example the app always vears left having you exit the expressway when it actually means to stay on the highway by vearing right. I would give it a much better rating when this error is corrected. Also i find it difficult to find refueling places on app and generating routes for trip stops."
316951,"Seems like a nice app. Just really strange that you have to email yourself the kml files to be able to open it. I work a lot with custom made kml maps (gps points, tracks etc). I tried to copy and paste it in the bookmarks folder but the app does not pick it up. Would have been amazing if I could just copy and paste the kml files using my pc with the phone connected. Seems really odd that such a simple thing needs such a work around to even open the kml."
316953,"I had high hopes for this app but it's been disappointing on many occasions. Despite downloading the required maps prior to losing internet access, they will not load when I am out and about without internet access. As soon as I am connected to the internet it comes to life. What's the point advertising the app as an offline maps app when it doesn't actually work that well?"
316955,"The maps are quite good but I'm not pleased that you cannot edit or remove comments or ratings on sites you visit , I rated a site and needed to ad a comment and it doesn't allow you to edit, now I know why there are so few ratings on places , a little stupid really, So I rated one it will be the last ."
316957,"It's fine. It seems unfinished sometimes. The lack of street names in the voice navigation makes it hard to use for navigation unless you have someone with you to be the navigator and tell you what the app is showing. The lack of street names also makes it unusable for navigation on my motorcycle where I depend solely on the voice prompts. To clarify, the streets were named in the app, and they even flashed across the top of the screen, they just weren't spoken in the voice prompts."
316959,"Poor tracking. Route finding rather slow. It locates to the local road net only slowly. (DFW area.) It's route finding was slow and somewhat poor quality. Once in motion it really didn't work. Do fix it up - - I'm dying for a solution that works on OSM data. Will check in again in six months or so."
316964,"DO NOT USE FOR NAVIGATION!!! This app does not provide the fastest or safest route, only the shortest distance-- if it works at all. This will take you onto roads which are dangerous, unpaved, or nonexistent. Thinks curves in the road are turns, so it constantly tells you to drive off the road. Instructions are vague: "slight right" is what it says when you should change to the right-hand lane. Dumb, half-broken, poorly uses GPS data, and Dev. is overly argumentative and unhelpful. AVOID!!!"
316967,"I tried reinstalling but the app is still tripping on my Galaxy S10. Road names are illegible (black boxes), some other signs like street names too - they turned white (on white background), the scale is no longer there etc. Don't have time to send you an email and seek advice. Nobody ain't got time for that in 2020. Will have to find another map app, which is a bummer after so many years with maps.me. Btw, searching for addresses and buildings in general has always been a nightmare..."
316968,"The app is almost there for me to use it exclusively. The only major feature that I can see is missing at this time is address interpolation. Much of my city has the house numbers only at the intersections. This means if you search for a house number that is not at an intersection it cannot find it."
316970,"This used to be a good app. Now it refuses to update the routes in certain parts of the uk and now is impossible to use to get to anywhere but the 4 places in the country that can be updated. I used this for work and now its totally useless. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling but its exactly the same. If this isn't fixed I'll be deleting the app permanently. At this moment in time I would not recommend this app to even my worst enemy (yes it really is that bad!!)"
316973,"Gave me notification spam, pestering me about some inane part of the app when I wasn't using it. Immediately uninstalled. Developers need to be punished for abusing the notification system (and using it as self-advertising). More and more apps are doing this and users end up drowning in constant useless notifications, and it will only get worse until people take a stand or app stores have to formulate stricter rules regarding them."
316974,"Problems, Problems, Problems! ------------ First when I installed the app & got some maps, they would disappear from the phone after each re-boot. So, I wrote to the developer. No reply after a month, I wrote back. No reply after two weeks. ------------- Next I uninstalled & re-installed the app (for the 12th time trying to fix the vanishing maps problem). Now the place in Settings to tell the app where to store the maps is gone. Gone! (The SD is 32 GB and has 31 GB free) I wrote the developer. After a week- no reply. ---------- Uninstall Warning: Each time I uninstalled the app., a large folder (Over 1 GB on mine) was left behind on the phone. One must use a file manager to delete it. --------- I Give Up (Which is too bad because this app is easy to use.) UPDATE- As shown below, the someone from the developer company posted suggestions. I had already tried (multiple times) what is suggested in the links the person posted. I also had already sent e-mails to the address shown. I will try one more time to contact them (because it looks like a fun & easy app). If no luck, I'll have to conclude that my phone and this app just won't play well together. UPDATE- Developer replied to this review and asked me for the name I used to contact them. I won't post my e-mail here. (That's not a comfortable thing to do.) I sent a new e-maill to them. I will update the review & star rating when (if) they reply & tell me how to make this application work."
316975,"Have used the app frequently on our trips for off-line walking mode routes and worked well. Just in the last week of a weeks long European vacation it has started to lag badly. We start to walk the route and the blue arrow doesn't move and then it suddenly jumps to catch up. This is even when we are out in an open area on a street. This was a great app and we really depended on it especially to find our accomodations in the historical parts of towns. Used to be 5 stars for us."
316976,"The app won't let you enter your own destination? It's an app of locations from which you can choose destinations. But, if you want to go to a place that is not already on the map, e.g., a new restaurant, it won't accept it. The closest it will accept is a street name without the number; that's useless to me. I guess that it would be okay for visiting a new city. It does have a lot of tourist locations."
316977,"Crashing since last upgrade (huawei p20, tested on more than 1 device, emui 9.1.0). The whole phone has to be restarted and all the bookmarks disappeared. Otherwise, my favourite app. Please have a look at it, I really want to score it 5 stars but I can't, as all my travel plans just got deleted, from 2 phones after the crash."
316979,"Voice guidance is awful: says keep right/left where I have to go straight, doesn't say exit numbers, doesn't say street names. Search is poor: shows the list, but how do I check these places on the map. I click the place and it shows my current location with the option to route to, but sometimes it shows the destination, go figure! No alternative routes, not optimal route, it can give the route which includes traffic lights, a couple of left turns instead of short residential road and right turn"
316980,"Why is the app required to be open when downloading/updating maps?? use an android service to do it in the background! so it continues to download/update even when the app is closed. / Annoyed that this hasn't been fixed yet, uninstalling, will start using Google Maps again which DOES have this feature for its offline maps."
316981,"Well, it used to be perfect app for me, but after latest update.... plenty of adds, fall asleep while navigating route, not working so smoothly as it used to. 5 stars for the old version and 1 star for latest. For now, i am thinking about downgrading or deleting it..."
316983,"had this app 3 or more times and the same problem. i lose all my maps when it needs an update. last friday after trying out the route planner it closed down for an update after my arrival, good job i knew where i was so i could make my own way back and yesterday it stopped loading compleatly so once again deleated. shame it is good when it works."
316988,"All of a sudden this app has turned rubbish. It was good a couple of years ago and I used to recommend it but tonight it has issues : 1) cannot locate me using wifi, phone signal, GPS...it states that I must be in a building. Google maps locate and finds a gps in this same location. 2) does not find Danang, Vietnam...it just lists a load of places in China So it's now proven to be unreliable when I most need it. Time to uninstall and stop recommending."
316990,"Not able to download Tamil Nadu, India Map. I have been using the app now for many years and it was working fine. Now I'm not able to download/update Tamil Nadu, India Map and able to download other maps. I tried all possibilities (clear storage, uninstall & reinstall, restart of phone etc. and still failing. I don't have any VPN and also I'm very close to the WIFI so no problem with that as well. As TN, India is my birth state and it is bad that I'm not able to download the map giving 1 star"
316993,"A big disadvantage is the fact that I can't save custom routes. So if I set a route and I add stops I can't then save that route. I have to add the stops everytime I want to use the same route. If this function was added I would definitely use this app as my GPS."
316995,"I used to use this app for the hiking trails and offline navigation. Even recommended to several people for that reason. Without warning they started charging $19.99 a year for that feature? I'm sorry but thats too much for something I might use once a month."
317000,"What was I even thinking..EU maps dont come anywhere close to gmaps...damn things dont even connect properly, tried here, there, and the rest (i am testing offline use) - Would love an alt to google maps, but you guys all suck, specially you, with your ads taking the stage,,horrible experience, with user experience being second/third rated; would rather live with crappy no-ads apps. TYVM."
317002,"This app is a really good app... but I find it should have a feature to find other routes to your destination, the app would usually find d the fastest way but sometimes u want to take a next route but don't know it off hand and to be able to see that feature come to past would make exploring your country /area/city while on your way to your destination"
317006,"downloaded this app to get ready for a trip to the uk. Can't seem to actually download the maps I want. Can;t figure out how to download the cities guides I want, seems to go in circles. Perhaps it is only friendly to the producers country of origin? Google maps will take me right to the city town  building I want. Can;t figure this one out. not user friendly at all."
317008,"can't search UK post code its a deal breaker for me. example: i want to go to new work place as i change them once a week and i cant find postcode. even if you will fix one postcode there will be always some missing. if i get this while im rushing at morning to another place it will be highly frustrating. i understand that UK has weird postcodes but if that won't work whole software will render useless"
317018,"Slow and broken for long distance travel. App slows randomly and takes forever to find a path. When you search for a location and see the name of the place you want to go to, you can't select until it loads all other relevant locations related to the query which wastes around 10 seconds. I'm using a PCT L29 Huawei phone for reference with the whole map downloaded with over 40gb of free space and no other application running. This is a terrible app. Use Google maps instead."
317022,"Liked this a lot 2years ago. It's still good just as a local map. But car navigation is poor. The app on 2 different phones sent us in different directions, and it makes ridiculous routing decisions. Can't rely on it, so sadly won't be using much."
317025,"Terrible directions. Did a test drive today on a route I know well. 1st mistake was telling me to take the second exit in the roundabout when that leads to the airport, all the exits are named streets and it should have been the third exit. Keeps telling me to keep left, keep right on a windy road with no exits. Tells me three streets and a half mile before the only possible turn for my destination to take a right. Tells me at an intersection to go left and without moving the car it states go right which was the correct way to go. Three major mistakes on a five mile trip is unacceptable. For reference tried out a different app on the return and it was 100% correct."
317027,"What is "Push notification" notifications category (in system settings)? Just for ads, as I see. Name notification categories correctly! If it's "About app functionality" — name it so."
317030,"Apparently it works offline but the GPS hardly ever does, on all the phones that I've used. The altitude meter never worked either. It's a constant disappointment as it's search function also requires internet. It basically serves very little purpose of you're not connected."
317031,"I can't download maps anymore even if i'm connected to the internet. I even tried to clear data, erase all the files, uninstall and install again but again it's not fixed. 😓😓🙁 Edit: thanks for the tip and pls add more detailed information about some locations because some are not found in the map..🤔"
317032,"Plenty of incorrect information, very lacking entries (it has a million hotels but none of the grocery stores), no way to report incorrect places in app, very meandering unoptimal walking suggestions and flat out incorrect public transport suggestions. It only gives you one route you cannot edit so if that bus or metro is out of commission good luck figuring out an alternative because maps.me won't help you. Edit: it is possible to add new info but not possible to report incorrect info."
317034,"Doesnt really work on my asus zenfone 3. Set my current location and my destination and press the start button, i can hear the initial voice command of direction. After that i presume the app will continue to run and i press the power button to off the phone screen and put it into my bag and ride my motorcycle. Throughout the journey, there is no voice command and once i reach my destination, i took out my phone and unlock the screen lock, i found the app still showing my starting location"
317038,"My BlackBerry device notified me that maps.me accessed to location permission and used from it, so I forced close maps.me for privacy problems but after a bit, my device renotified me that maps.me accessed to location! Maps.me opened itself without running it. why this app needs location access always? And open itself?"
317043,"The maps are inaccurate and the places wrong with no way to correct their location. People will end upnin the wrong place using this and that's the minimum one can ask of a map, accuracy. As for offline map needs, thank goodness for good old ink and paper."
317046,"I like this application.. but I am angry because this application not give me short way always give me longer ways to arrive at my departure.. and doesn't have multi ways in routing to I can choose the best way I like... responsible I hope you repair this problem.. and if you add camera speeds and camera light that your application will be great as free application.. not as money"
317048,"The good; Open Street editor, adds aren't annoying. The bad; no rooting option's. Answer to reply: in a car more it rooted the way to local hospital true third grade asphalt road and in one part to uncategorized no asphalt road. While in the circling & walking mode it rooted it correctly true highlights available priority roads. Somehow this should be the other way around. You need to add more rooting option's & ability to exclude certain roods to users."
317051,"This app causes full page ads to pop up even when not using the app. very aggrivating app. It took me awhile to realize this was the app causing the problem. After uninstallign it, the problem was gone. Avoid this very problematic app!! I would rate it minus 10 stars if possible."
317054,"Love it but! It works well on my phone without an issue but if I install it on my Atoto car stereo it disappears after a week or so. Gone without a trace. It will re install fine but will once again pull a Houdini on me. The Atoto stereo uses the Android operating system."
317055,"Don't bother. Can't download all of the US maps as a set have to D/L individual maps. Can't get more than a few maps to completely D/L. Most maps get almost all the way D/I'd then stop. After attempting to re-D/L each map several times I'm giving up. Who knows it may actually be a good GPS, but with poor support its not worth it."
317056,"I'm in middle of Delhi walking on road and it doesn't locate my Position through GPS! (It says you might be in a building please come out!) When I turned on my internet it recognised my location. Does it really work offline? If not why shouldn't I go for Google Maps?"
317057,"The offline maps are good, although their quality and completeness varies from region to region. However, the navigation functionality is quite useless: the proposed routes are often long detours, one can't choose alternative routes and the times are way too short."
317060,"good needs some basic improvement and to add some rudimentary features like adding a sign after you visit a place either bookmarked or is a part of some guide to know which place you already visited since some of us visit dozens of places and just a few at a time and also when downloading alot of guides make an option for them to work as one option instead of confusing us with all the different colors, been using maps.me over 2 years now and i really want to keep using it so please update it"
317061,"Pixel 2 (Stock Android) Feb/2019: Looks promising but app rarely works properly. Even while traveling abroad, Google Maps Offline worked great but MAPS.ME Offline did not work at all - couldn't even find my location, let alone use navigation. You may have a different experience than I did but I cannot rely on it, and hence, will not recommend it. Hope they fix the issues."
317064,"Searching for a street referenced with the suburb of a city results in a "not found". Alternatively searching for the same street referenced with the city instead, brings up all the streets in all the suburbs with that name including the street that you are looking for, but the difficulty then is working out which street is the one you bu to the city. This is incredibly cumbersome. The app is not suitable for driving as its positioning capability is not accurate enough and responsive enough."
317070,"I had a nightmare using the app while on vacation cruising from Sydney, Australia to Hawaii... It pissed me so bad!!! I couldn't scroll the map like in Google maps normally... I always need to go opposite side to look something in Sydney and the same in Hawaii and the Pacific islands, and I'll sugest to add the option like in google maps to measure distance with a straight line."
317071,"It seems there is no bus route for Berlin. If there is kindly show me a snapshot of how to use it. I try to check directions for Bus and S+U bahn trip. Let me know how I can get to my destination using Bus and S-Bahn in Berlin. Your app is really good for walking navigation."
317072,"The application has gotten worse and bloated with unnecessary functions. I don't want ads, nor do I want to pay you to get rid of them; I don't want those stupid dots on the map denoting entrances. I guess, all good apps befall the same fate... Thumb down."
317073,"No speed limitations."
317076,"App stops working on my android head unit (px5) after the latest update. The app is not opening on my andorid head unit (px5 MODEL). It just showing black screen. I already tried to unsinstall and reinstalled it but still the same. I also clear cache and clear data but it did not help. It is not loading only black screen when I try to open. After that it shows error to send report to developers."
317078,"Downloaded this app to use on a trip. It clearly said I had the offline map downloaded yet when I entered in the exact address or a category.. It said zero results found even though I knew the address was within my downloaded map. Poor experience. I reconnected with at a McDonald's and only then did the address show up. If this app requires you to have data then google maps is better."
317079,"The application is very convenient. However, some space names are incorrect. For example, the Nagorno-Karabakh territory belonging to the Azerbaijan Republic has been identified as a separate republic. Which no country in the world recognizes this Nagorno-Karabakh as a republic, and the occupation of this territory by the United Nations has been proven by four UN resolutions and requires unconditional release of the territory. I hope you will make changes to the application. Thanks!"
317080,"i like this app but please indicate motorcycle in the choices of transport use , most person here in our country which is philippines uses motorcycle but some highway cant pass by, like nlex,sctex expressway etc. but motorcycle that has 400cc can pass by in nlex,sctex, expressway etc. but below cant . please incate in the map another route that every motorcycle can pass by .thank you"
317083,"Works alright for international (outside US) travel. Was a huge help when I traveled to Japan. That being said, I can't give an app full stars when they have an icon with a notification artificially inserted. Please remove this."
317085,"Im so disappointed about the update because its very unreliable why because i checked how much time it takes before i get to a place for example i want to travel 100km and it says it will take 1hour but when i check it google maps it was 2hour im like what??? The old version of this that i download in 2017 was better because it was very accurate its almost like an google map but offline but now it sucks you guys dont believe me then go check yourself"
317086,"search is extremely limited, app can't even find the place I am searching for when I am sitting in the parking lot right in front of it. I understand OSM is crowd sourced, but at very least someone should be able to enter an address and find it, even if the business name isn't locatable, without having to rely on the community to do so first."
317089,"I have just downloaded this app. Selected the 'Southern Thailand' map. Surprised to see that street names etc are written in Lao rather than Thai. This is bizarre."
317090,"I tried two different addresses and neither was found. It seems as though this app, along with others of its type can not identify suburbs despite them being clearly shown on the main map. Or maybe the app struggles when the same road passes through several suburbs?"
317091,"Not impressed. GPS movement is very choppy, like it is going to the next page in a book. Stopped, the icon wanders on the screen. It's not the phone, as stock map works smoothly. Will continue to look for an option to the stock map."
317094,"Constantly locks up. Paid to not have ads, after I installed the app I was getting full screen popup adds. Ads have gone away. I installed a monitor app to determine what was causing the ads. Just today installed the Maps.me update and will not run. When i move a downloaded map to an SD card Maps.me hand up."
317095,"i like being able to share my location, but nothing else worked. It doesn't speak road names, kept telling me to make random turns in a straight path, and wants to use Google Services for location. If I wanted to use Google for mapping, I'd use Google Maps or Waze."
317100,"99% of the time you search for an address it just gives you a picture of a dog holding a dinner bowl saying "Oops! Address not found" Can't search by the name of the business/landmark/attraction/building either. Generally maps.me winds up with me going to find a wifi hot-spot and resorting to Google maps instead."
317104,"Was great until it suddenly stopped working. I used this all round Singapore. Now when I make a route offline it just says no transit available at this time. I was told this is great for all countries but clearly it doesn't work!"
317105,"Everytime there is an upgrade you have to reload all your maps. This is a pain esp if you have limited internet access. Would also be useful for footpaths / cross country walking routes are not white but a colour that makes it easier to see"
317106,"Poor for walking as does not lock to one location.when touched as happens with a phone resets to another location. Using latest download. Easy to replicate walk outside select a walking destination and inadvertantly touch the screen and focus moves to a new unwanted location."
317107,"Great app. But haven't opened in three months and still number one battery user. Crazy."
317110,"it was a great app but..as it got more and more "features"... it took up more and more memory and it's way more complicated ....it's still a good app but not a great app anymore...wish we had a choice ...it wasm't broke... why"d you "fix" it ?"
317116,"Very good mapping. Detail is exceptional. I wish map.me could differentiate between foot paths & dirt/unpaved roads. You can waste alot of time looking for something only to find its inaccessible. I would use in conjunction with another map source such as. Google maps & or OS map."
317118,"This seriously needs human intervention. This app is designed by computer. This app needs to learn to use numbering system etc. as a means of obtaining addresses. Also voice needs to state street names. Left right left right is minimally helpful, everything about this app is way too much headache."
317123,"I used it a couple of years ago in Germany and it was fine. It is totally useless though in Brisbane, Australia. The app could only get the streets name right and was clueless about the street numbers."
317127,"Well... The lag I experienced walking Palermo was ridiculous. Standing on corners waiting for the map to catch up. Could not keep up a slow walking pace. So ended up doubling back several times, missing turns. Not so great. 🤷"
317131,"Worked perfectly, until the update last August. After that, it can't plan routes anymore, supposedly due to a "system error: unable to create route due to an application error." The starting and end points end up somewhere in the sea at lonlat [0;0]."
317132,"I will write again my review because seems that the developers are not getting it.This app was working beautifully but for some reason TTS has stopped working and before you send me again to the link explaining how to setup the TTS I will let you know that my Google TTS is working perfectly fine with ALL my apps but, it's not working with MAPS.ME so, there is nothing I can do... It is all in your hands as developers. Good luck finding out the issue"
317136,"It sucks. Doesn't read GPX files and has sent me to nonexistent roads. UPDATE after developer's answer: Are you nuts? Every other navigation application directly supports reading GPX files, which have became a de facto standard! If you don't and also do not have plans to support them in the future, I will uninstall the app and unrecommend it to everybody else! Who wants to be dependent on an online GPX=>KML conversion web page in the middle of a desert?! UPDATE 2: Even Google Earth supports opening GPX files, as it does some magic of importing the files ot its own KML format when trying to open a GPX file on it. UPDATE 3. Why the hell the red circle with a number one on the icon?! I am always thinking I have a notification, I open the app and there is nothing new inside!!!"
317137,"What attracted me was that it's an offline map. But after a few months use it begins telling me I must be in a tunnel. Every single time. It only works when I am online. If I upgrade, will it keep the locations I have saved?"
317140,"The first screenshot shows transit directions in the UK. I live in the UK so that sold me on the app. I downloaded the app, and tried out transit directions, only to be told that transit directions are not available in my area. I guess I'm stuck with Google maps."
317141,"Sincerally. I've using on app, and him very bad. Don't serv for diagnostic precise and better routes here in the state of Sao Paulo. I've serious problems with access also at Internet, where don't can report with it app. Very pessim don't recommend here in Brazil 👎"
317148,"not impressed with searching for an address residing in a different state. the 'help' info says to zoom in on thT different state, then try the address. no other help?... like how do you know when the app has successfully 'zoomed'a state... so that the app is ready to receive the search?"
317153,"I purchased maps.me when it wasn't free and now this app wants me to pay for removing ads from ads-free app which I already purchased. Google, can you please ban this developer?  RE: It's up to you how you spend money which you received for my purchase. It was not 4-year subscription. It was a lifetime purchase. I do understand you are doing fraud here - sell application to make it add-free, then make it free and return adds back to get money from advertisers after you got money from customers which wanted to remove adds. I'm going to report to Google about this issue and ask for a refund at least."
317157,"Offline maps search results: South airport, north airport, platenoum, auditorio.. what is this? are you kidding. I need just a whole map of Tenerife island. And a little part of water around. But I can't choose region myself, I must choose only from your list. pity"
317163,"It took me all around a city to get to my destination and I knew that something was wrong with it. Later on discovered that there was a direct road, much shorter. And gave some other strange suggestions. Wouldn't trust it.  Edited:   I was going back from Zagreb to Banja Luka. The address was Rudeška cesta in Zagreb, so instead of sending me on the road called Zagrebačka avenija which turns into Slavonska avenije and goes straight onto the highway to Banja Luka, it directed me onto some small side streets and then some other highways - it simply didn't make sense."
317172,"I am unable to download any maps. No error message, just a red circle for download progress"
317183,"Downloaded a map on a metered network automatically without asking. The dark theme is unpleasant. The quality of the map is poor so you're lucky if you get street addresses in results. It can get you as far as the street the place is on. Works better for businesses than houses."
317185,"Thought this was good until tried to get a route via public transport in Hong Kong; once I've entered start and finish and tap the 'train' symbol, it tells me 'no pedestrian routes available!' ; tried several times so sure I'm not tapping the wrong button - is this a known bug?"
317189,"It takes 5-15 minutes to find my location every time i open the app. If i used google maps or another app, it instantly finds my location. If this bug/delay gets fixed then this app would be 5 stars because of the great offline feature"
317195,"I had used these maps earlier during my international travels. However, last week I was in London and observed that the maps, especially the walking navigation, was getting significantly stuck and unable to consistently point me to the right direction."
317203,"Im in nepal and installed maps.me When i download my local map (nepal eastern region) it keeps downloading to 94% and then says 'download failed'. my phone is google pixel xl. i did successfully download another map (iceland) as a test, but even after reinstall i still cant download the local (nepal) map."
317206,"When I drove on US inter-state highways, the latest version of this app told me to get off the highway at each and every exit , then told me to get back onto the same highway when I did exit. Such a bug rendered this app totally useless."
317207,"It does not update instantly location on map. When walking, location does not change right away so if you need to turn, you have no idea if your turn happens now or not. Anything competing against google but this app is good for nothing."
317208,"maybe my expectations are different than most, but I want to be able to put in a street address and then recieve directions to navigate to the address. This app is unable to do that. I put in a street address and it can only show the street, not the place I want to go to."
317209,"still don't know why MAPS.ME always Don't FIND my exact location every time i use it even if i am in an open place and some times it shows a different location in the map for example i am at home but in the map my location is in another place it dosint really determine my exact location so please fix this problem because it's not being useful it's useless to me and it is so disappointing for a costumer like me so please fix 😓😓😓"
317211,"The maps were not accurate and this app didn't always give us voice directions which got us lost a few times and frustrated. Especially when traveling in a foreign country where road and street signs are not always easy to see."
317215,"Can you guys work on your multiple stops, it's really really rough. I would take a look at Google Maps and do what they do and refine on it. Not to be blunt, but it's really not an intuitive and fluid experience."
317223,"Been using this for a year but after i upgraded my OS to oreo, my gps icon starts showing a gray icon(less accurate location right?) Constantly. I've tested other map applications but the location is good and shows the blue icon. I hope this will be fixed soon."
317230,"Please help me, the application and it's contents are brilliantly made, but I am an android user no matter how try to log in the application response is log in error, I tried with countless emails and Gmail it is just not working, please make it right"
317231,"For me was number 1 map before. Now...Cant find existing street in Latin, (has alt name in Cyrillic also)... example, Somborska, Nis, Serbia. First one is 141km away. Thats why this app is not so reliable."
317233,"don't want free guide, but this insists on setting a notification for that. irritating. if you don't give me a way to kill that notification, this app will be history with bad review. one notification is enough. useless group of people. numerous emails over weeks, asking for one detail at a time. DONE!"
317235,"I can't search for a simple street address.  All I get is an Oops message that it can't find the address.  What good is an app that can't find a simple address in a major US city?  And yes, I have the appropriate map downloaded.  App deleted."
317236,"Map should have been updated years ago. I should update the map? How is that even reasonable for someone travelling to a region they haven't been to (I'm assuming all the maps are out of date)"
317240,"Latest version has a problem as it close immediately. I have Galaxy Note 9 Android 9"
317241,"I would rate one star but that's not an option. I was staying in Athens a few nights and when I searched for Acropolis (literally the largest and most major attraction) nothing showed up. The map is there but everything else is lacking"
317248,"To read the privacy policy, I have to first consent to a cookie policy before I can understand and agree (or disagree) to the privacy policy. This has to be fixed before you get out of beta."
317251,"Works mostly fine, but one time i openened a location from Whatsapp and it showed me the wrong place. This mistake cost me 50€. Be carefull, if you have a appointment and try to get Wifi for Google Maps."
317256,"i really enjoyed using this app for a couple of years. unfortunately the crashes became more frequent so i will have to search for something else. pity though. device : samsung galaxy s3."
317259,"Currently traveling in Israel. Does not find many famous landmarks (like the four gates of jerusalem old town). Navigation makes terrable route selections. Same starting and ending points: google maps- 1h2min (78km) , Maps.me - 2h 9min (142km)....how?"
317260,"Spying map why you guy's need to access photos it's not logical permission for a map to do it's work 👎 and so funny if i didn't not allow the access for photos gallery it doesn't at all work . You guys its a map need only location permission not more gallery and contacts and and ... shame on you"
317261,"I really like the UI but not being able to search addresses is a major downfall. Feature requests... 1. Searchable addresses, most times nothing is found. 2. Speed limit visual 3. Speed limit alert with option to turn off alarm on overspeed."
317266,"Excruciatingly annoying Impossible to search without app insisting on downloading more maps. Deleting. Even after downloading a bunch of maps the app doesn't allow route planning. Just the boring freeways. Might as well use Waze or Google Maps. The search goes on."
317268,"Before I update the app, I can track my current location from the other without any data and internet connections. But now, I need to do it. It seems a hassle! What if I don't have data? Will definitely lost!"
317269,"Forces me to give the complete storage access before even explaining why. Common guys, it's 2k19. UPD: The permission is required on startup even before saving anything in local storage which makes no sense for me. Guys, you are just misusing the runtime permissions functionality."
317271,"Always wants to connect to the Internet, even when you force stop the app. Difficult to enter an address to go to. Quite slow calculating a route."
317278,"Suggestions: 1. Add home screen shortcut of navigation destination 2. Route overview / navigation view switch. Basically a min/max zoom switch with proper orientation 3. Provide alternative route with time/distance difference information in overview mode."
317285,"Not a good app, tried it today and it froze 3 times and had to force close and start again. It can't find simple postcodes, can't use when it freezes while navigating. Use Magic Earth app, free offline maps, doesn't freeze and just as good."
317290,"please add good features like Google maps and sygic have. like speed while driving. and most important it is still difficult to choose through which road i want to travel. Google maps have better information about roads than you. thanks for replying."
317292,"It's mostly useful, but just eating my phones battery, it drains batteries 4x faster than e.g. Google maps, OK it's good to work offline but I've stayed without phone most of the time because of died battery :( make something to it and MAPS.ME is just perfect for other functions!"
317293,"It is good but i cannot find the country i want to find. It cannot find location in buildings. It also said that map might be inaccurate. I am not sure if it us updated"
317303,"Was excellent, but now too complex and slow. Also autostarts on boot despite me turning off permission. I only want it to run when I need a map, not all the time killing my battery. Gonna try an old version."
317304,"If there is one good thing about this app it's that it makes me appreciate Google maps. Seriously, what kind of mapping app doesn't let you search for addresses? What possible use can this thing have?"
317305,"Search function is close to zero, from time to time it notifies you, that ALL downloaded maps have to be updated, though there are no changes after that."
317310,"Good gui. Small size maps. But innacurate with map, don't know some adresses, which know others nav apps. 3 year same bug, when show turn, while no turn on the road, u have straight road ahead."
317318,"The app is far too bulky and can barely run on my phone, once I open it everything freezes and my phone becomes unusable, it's even caused my phone to reset. if it wasn't for offline maps I certainly wouldn't use it."
317319,"Calculate of find long Route is not fast and is slow even on High End Mobile phone, but another Map apps are so fast in find Route even on long Route Darkmode is only available for Navigation Wish this app have UTM Coordinate, HUD Navigation, Darkmode in Map and Persian Speech language or use Google Speech."
317324,"Cant enter street address numbers. The street I live on is literally listed in the wrong town. It shows up on the map properly in the correct place, but you have to enter the neighboring town to find it. 100% failure on the first search i ever tried."
317328,"great app, very detailed off line maps. my bigget problem with the app is that it doesnt show relief. using this app in the back country would be great if it could show the hills"
317330,"Installed this in January while travelling and gave up as I couldn't get voice navigation to work. Installed it again to give it another go but still no voice navigation. What's the point of a silent satnav???"
317332,"Kindly make it possible to search by typing at the bookmarks section. The only option is to scroll through a long list of bookmarked items. It's time-consuming."
317334,"Tried to use it in Paris. Ugh. Every time I walked on a covered sidewalk, and lost GPS it would be totally confused when I got back outside. on one walk, I had to reenter my destination 3 times. I finally quit and used a paper map. I'm deleting."
317336,"Last few weeks I am noticing weird colored blocks [square or rectangle shaped] on my maps. No legend or any information about what they are. Really destroying the user experience."
317337,"This is the 3rd time the map has turned black and cannot be used. No help on help.page at all. Happened when i was cycle touring in France and Spain and was relying on it for route finding. Not reliable."
317344,"This maps is way better than others but once i tried with my long ride, it just led me the shortest way and way more dangerous, it would be better if the devs make this for shortest path but way more safer, i hope this will be fix"
317346,"For some reasons, a previous downloaded map was removed after updated recently. Tried to download that map again several times but couldn't. The app seemed to start the download but failed at the end without any feedback."
317348,"This might be a great app, but why does it need full access to your tablet or phone files when supposedly it just need access to gps ? I'd give it a few more stars if it wasn't for that. Stay out of my private info'"
317350,"The app is great. Unfortunately, when I turn off the LTE, it keeps changing my location in every 10 seconds. I assume the GPS is malfunction. Could you pleass fix the location issue? Thank you."
317359,"Downloading to update maps no longer working, I have fast internet but I don't know why suddenly this happens. This app is very handy but now this bug makes it less reliable. I hope it will be fixed."
317364,"It's a great and useful application but still misses a lot if other streets. As a result,there is a limitation as to what how far it maybe useful"
317369,"I like the offline features and maps, but the public transportation options need to be updated. It is unable to locate public transportation options for certain places that absolutely have them."
317371,"Subscriptions is not for me and i hate ads, so i am deleting maps.me after almost 5 years. I switched to Guru Maps, which is ad-free and offers a cheap once off purchase."
317373,"This app use to have no ads...stick to google maps."
317374,"The newly added house for sale ads cluttering the map on a small screen truly degrade what was a fine app!!"
317379,"This app works well, but it uses 17 (!) trackers according to the analysis by Exodus Privacy, which means 17 third-parties know what you are doing when using this app! \o/"
317381,"Good for traveling within a car (or something like it) but when you switch to pedestrian, the app can't locate you, you ends up being away from where you wanted to be. To be fixed!"
317383,"Every time I start writing address from street number, this app says OOOPS, we don't know it. How do you find places, with street name only? But some streets kilometers long! I downloaded my city, and it can't even find my kids schools. How do you use it?!"
317405,"This app wants access to my photos and files. Why maps need it? To still and use for own purpose. I prefer paid service. Actually users have to pay for maps. But this app still need access to files. This is unacceptable"
317406,"very limited area maps available, & very bad - insist always on/running in background & go ty internet"
317407,"It takes a lot of time to detect accurate location on my OnePlus 3 And it would be good if you add a offline guide of country "NEPAL". Finally, you guys are doing a great job. 🙂"
317415,"i've been trying to download the maps (Philippines) but I encountered problem downloading. though my internet was good. the storage space is also okay. is there anyway, to download the maps particularly Metro Manila. suggestions will be highly appreciated. tia"
317416,"map just sucks in India. it shows blank barren land where i live infact there are many streets and roads(clearly visible in google map and here maps) may be openstreet map is not perfect lets hope it will get better in future but for now it is unusable."
317424,"handy and accurate, but the search function only gives exact matches which is tricky when traveling in foreign countries, and it gave me a notification explaining the bookmarks feature after I'd already bookmarked several places. Minor but annoying"
317425,"Crash fix works, but requires access to a PC (or a rooted phone). Works well for offline maps. Has too many spam notifications and popups to use regularly."
317426,"If you need to plan the route, you won't find the public transportation in this app. There is only metro, no buses, no trams, etc. Therefore this app doesn't make sense. Please add this option"
317429,"UK postcode search doesn't work making this close to useless. [edit - thanks for the response, the post code appears in OSM but not in your app, along with most I have tested. I'll email details as requested.]"
317433,"last few versions, the user position badge diappears when switching between apps. end up having to restart maps.me numerous times to get user position arrow to reappear. otherwise, maps.me is superior to all other map apps."
317438,"It does nothing but hassle you to give them 7.euros per year for evermore. It's not logical and I couldn't make it talk to me. Nice clear maps though."
317440,"good app but too many incorrect locations marked, and no way to correct or send feedback. also gives message saying no pedestrian directions available when selecting public transport in myanmar."
317441,"Great app before the last updates. I used it for all my adventures through the island but now it show bad advices and false routes. Is it possible to get old maps and apps. Thank you"
317446,"I could put up with all the previous map and direction errors, BUT after the last update it won't even start up! This app now officially sucks and I have no choice but to uninstall it."
317448,"I'm not at all pleased that I'm being hit with advertising after already paying $4.99 for the ad free version. Now this app wants an extra $4 every year to remove the ads that I already played to remove."
317451,"Keeps giving application error when doing routing after latest updates. I tried Wanaka and Queenstown New Zealand and kept getting application error. Tried reinstalling but no go. Once my favorite but now have to uninstall it. Latest updates broke it."
317459,"All I want is a simple map that can get me from home to work and points of interest by entering an address.  I can't even enter my own address on this map.  I do like that you can download map for an entire state or country.  But what good is that if I can't even enter an address."
317464,"Maybe im doing something wrong but if you are connected to wifi it works great, if you are not connected the app doesnt even open, it just stays on the maps. Me startup screen forever"
317468,"Mostly very good, but if you have location disabled to save battery (or for privacy reasons) it nags you with popups, a distracting blue spinner etc. Such a shame."
317481,"App keeps crashing a few seconds after I open it! I used to rely so much on this app while hiking but now I'm super lost without it. Please fix it!"
317490,"Great useful app but always difficulties with downloading maps - it stops and needs to be manually started many times each small region, "update all" simply doesn't work. Can you fix it?"
317492,"too many missing places compared to other maps, searching places is damn too slow and it lacks information like how far it will be. I hope it can improve overtime."
317501,"Frustrating app, trying to import a kml file. No help what so ever"
317512,"I tried the app, but it was unable to find addresses in the search. Yugoslavia addresses kept appearing as I started typing (I didn't install Yugoslavia), but local addresses in the Portland Oregon area didn't exist. Not useful at all to me."
317525,"Really useful app. Latest update has changed the text style of hiking trail names, meaning they are now illegible which is incredibly frustrating."
317528,"I paid for this app and now they are charging me to use it. The cost is more than Garmin GPS systems and don't get the hardware."
317529,"If someone send you his position, it says you need to download maps.me to see it... but i already have maps.me, and it doesn't open the location...."
317532,"keeps crashing and will not read my location I tried many times to install this app the first time it would not recognise my chromebooks location the second time it just keeps closing also i did try to go to your website but the webpage would not open neither would the email address"
317533,"After I click the update, it stop at 59% I uninstalled it and install it again it stop at the same percentage. The worst part, the app is gone now after I uninstalled it. I clear the cache & storage but no avail"
317544,"Works good before. Then update came, it only works when I'm online. Great job. Maps. Me online map should be the name."

317549,"I am surprised to see it as editors choice...Definitely isn't..Doesn't find addresses...I still don't know if I need to enter the door number first and then street name or reverse..Doesnt work in any case."
317554,"It was a good app, but since they put ads i can't say it anymore. Furthermore they are using the free openstreetmap wich is good. But monetising à free and collaborative map. Just à shame."
317557,"I've been using the app for a long time and today after an automatic update it stopped working. It crashes Everytime before it even starts. Please fix the bug!!!! Xiomi redmi note 4"

317587,"download great but couldn't find places. I ended up using Google maps. I could search for places. save as favorite and go to them when offline"
317589,"Maps are good but... GPS going crazy sometimes. Same as on iPhone and Android. And add please a normal human language during route."
317590,"Something really wrong with this app but if I uninstall and reinstall it I'll loose all my saved points again. Won't find anything I search for, even if it's spelt correctly, I have to find it manually after searching on Google maps."
317592,"Potentially very useful, but the app still can't track my location. No, I'm not in a tunnel or building and yes, location is enabled on my phone!!"
317594,"No good for me. I was looking for a Google maps alternative. This isn't it. A waste of my mobile data to download this and the map which was separate. YMMV."

317596,"Map looked good, but unable to work out how to create a route"
317598,"I would give 5 star I am trying to buy the ad free version of this app but it's says unavailable for this purchase. I really love this app and i want to buy. Please provide the solution."
317600,"Mostly shows wrong travel time many times. Google map shows perfect time. Need more improvement in this application with online feedback."

317613,"Stack while Settings page opening. Reinstall didn't help. Android 10"

317699,"The app keeps closing on itself on HTC U11 with Android 8.0. It's totally useless. As soon as you open it, it crashes."
317708,"CHEATER. I paid for it earlier and liked it. Now you added "Ad removal". LIE. You actually introduced ad and blackmail your users to remove it. Nasty once people paid already. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS VERSION."
317720,"It's a little much better than before though sometimes it can't find some of the places I'm searching and it's slow in finding route."
317723,"Since 3 days lost all of my bookmarks (about 500 places) after activating backup functionality... How could it be?"
317730,"Great maps but it sent me a notification about the bookmarks feature when i haven't opened the app in a week. Notfications blocked."
317733,"Great app, but as far as download catalog does not work (just empty screen and retry button appear) is useless for me. I can use Google Maps then."
317736,"I bought this app a while ago and now they decided to show ads in a paid app even though I was clearly told I wouldn't have ads with the purchase. This app is a fraud and I couldn't recommend it to anyone."
317737,"great! wish you could save bookmarks to an account and transfer to new phones though. also randomly once it uninstalled and i lost all my bookmarks"
317739,"I can't download any map. The app asks me for checking the internet connection, but it has no sense, because WiFi is working well in other apps."
317741,"Cannot download my city map... Many tymes i unistall and reinstall but it say retry after 95% of city download i want to download my city map kathmandu bt it will not download....i check my internet and its speed bt cannot get the city..so ...worse app"
317744,"while it's very detailed, it seems like there's no way to search via postal code in Singapore?"
317748,"was checking out alternatives to google maps. installed this but had issues with navigation. in texas could not find the correct n glenville rd to plot to business location. deleted app."
317751,"It's a best offline app but there is no any sign of such areas in its maps. Even some main roads are invisible. Kindly update its maps enough rather than developing optins further."
317753,"completely usless, does not allow the user to set routs on an existing map. it was mearly usable few years ago but deteriorated completley. a huge dissappointment."
317756,"Not good for rural areas - uninstalled after being unable to find several small towns. Was hoping to be able to use for when service was unavailable."
317760,"Just another Google. Tracks you intrusively, claims propriety on the data, and barrages you with misleading ads for paid subscriptions. Oh, and the maps are Deficient compared to Google's."
317762,"The map data is great but the search function (especially offline) is terrible. App often crashes when trying to search for a place."
317763,"Unable to find anything. Anything slightly smaller seems to be omitted from this map. Sticking with Google maps. This was pointless."
317777,"Not good it can't pinpoint my location when i turn on the GPS.. and i have downloaded the Offline map !! What kind of offline map features dose this application have ?? It is useless"
317792,"watch out! I was charged. this was very unclear. I unsubscribed and uninstalled. Then I see I continue to be charged weekly for no ads!"
317793,"When I start navigation along a route, the interface becomes really less responsive and the arrow head takes a lot of time to point in the direction my phone's head is facing."
317794,"App doesn't work when i closing the screen, it means that i can't use it when i riding my motorcycle. Please fix this issue."
317798,"I could not download. When downloaded till 62%, it's ceasing to be downloaded"
317800,"Hi, the app maps me doesn't show me the clear map, it doesn't show me the oceans, the continents. This all happened after the last update"
317812,"Really, the roads are white on light beige! How about some style settings to help the contrast impaired. Are there any map apps that target those over 40?"
317815,"Download popup is annoying. Once it is clicked by mistake no way to stop the downloading. I lost my mobile memory due to few mistaken downloads."
317817,"Add minimize option., just like in Google maps and I can't hear the voice navigation., I really like maps.me.,"
317818,"Great app but search feature is horrible, 80% of the time you can't find the place/address you're looking for. Really annoying"
317820,"Address links don't automatically search into maps.Me. Makes it a no go. Uninstalled. Ads a annoying and pricey considering occasional use only to pay yearly to get rid of them."
317823,"No, you don't actually need storage permission to save maps. Look up Context.getExternalFilesDir which gives storage for apps without any permission on API 19+."
317831,"Could you change the voice of the navigation guide? She speaks too fast and her voice sounds disgusting!"
317833,"Map shown on the program does not comply with the real map. The map of Azerbaijan shown here does not correspond with the valid one. Moreover, there is fictioned, not existing nagorno-karabakh republic."
317853,"CHEATS DON'T BUY! I Paid for this in the past. Now they want more money. The understanding with Google and developers is that you only pay once. This is wrong. Please do not support this behavior. Your response does not change the fact that I bought an ad-free version."
317855,"Try to complete the search list as much as you can as there are some places not available in the search list."
317856,"The worst offline maps that I have ever used. Added a full 2 hours to my trip traveling through small villages and cities instead of highways"
317859,"You need to do some changes in this map. You have a big mistake in Azerbaijan boundries.The name "Nagorna-Karabakh" is not exist,Here is officially land of Azerbaijan as Karabakh(Qarabağ) It is shown that,this problem had already mentioned before. but you did not do any action.Therefore I give you one star!"
317864,"Not able to search by street address. Downloaded Sygic instead."
317873,"can not find places i put in here we go finds them with no problems and it works offline to with no ads this one has a lot of ads 0 stars if i could.."
317875,"App crashes immediately after launching. Have tried deleting and redownloading maps and uninstalling and reinstalling. Very frustrating because it looks great."
317876,"Can't search by street address detail, e.g. 501 Shane cir. Can only search by street name, e.g. Shane circle, for me this makes the app unusable as can't navigate from start to finish."
317877,"After installation of app my iGO stooped to work. I uninstalled Maps.me - didn't help. Found some its folder and deleted it, also several times tried to re-install iGO - didn't help. Seems the it makes somewhere permanent changes preventing iGO to work."
317879,"I like the offline maps, but it won't input a street address, just the name of a town (sometimes). That makes it pretty useless for me."
317885,"Annoying notifications cannot be turned off. I rate it low for this spam. And for outdated map details."
317893,"This app nevers fails to disappoint me.it doesn't make any progress! Nevers shows online traffic and never offers other possible routs simultaneously."
317895,"for nepal: maps not up to date, bad localisation and ETAs entirely inaccurate. This one time, we followed a road for 20min while the app indicated we were heading off into the wild"
317901,"Uninstalled I used to use Maps.me all the time and loved it but now it can almost never find my location and crashes constantly."
317903,"Good app but since interrupting updates a couple of months ago it permanently says there are 3 updates available ...but won't download them or change status. ...a bit annoying!"
317904,"For central places, it is great but when you really need it says you are in a unknown place."
317907,"The maps are not up-to-date. Made a long walk only to find out that there was no place I was searching for, even though it was marked on the map."
317909,"its hard to locate local places as well as it s more friendly. I hope you could update more tagline to update locations."
317915,"Unable to download any part of the map using wi-fi or cellular network connection. Android Pie, Xiaomi Mi Mix 3"
317920,"In all my travels the app didn't let me down, always took me to the right place, but last week in Milano, nothing, the app kept blocking, taking me to wrong routes...disappointing"
317923,"I'm smack in the middle of Munich in a penthouse and this app can't locate me, just hangs. I even have location accuracy enabled. Useless. Uninstalled 10 min later."
317935,"The app used to work well but from one day to the other I cannot open it anymore. Restart and reinstallation didn't help."
317937,"it wants access to my files and media. I would allow storage. Android and app developers need to provide a way to isolate which folder an app can access."
317938,"The maps is very complete but the direction suggestion is not and it only suggest one way to the destination which is not the best Also the traffic doesn't work at all"
317941,"I bought Maps.Me PRO version in the past to remove ads. Then Maps.me became free for everyone, then now it's asking for support by paying weekly or annually to remove ads again. What a rude…"
317948,"After downloading map tried to route between two points- “due an system app error cant route“ Tried a few times... Not working. Sry, but checking for alternatives..."
317949,"Offline feature is nice, but Mapsme is not able to find an adresse when you type it... You need to find it on the map."
317951,"Don't know what to say.  Downloaded ap and maps and it cannot look up a simple address.  Tells me I need to zoom in on area to search. . .  If I don't know where it is I can't find it?  Not very useful.  Directions are minimal at best.  Not worth the time."
317958,"Was good, allows offline mapping etc but i couldn't update the maps. Out of date apps are no good to me so the app was uninstalled"
317964,"I used this once on a long trip in the Philippines. Sadly it directed me to go over some pretty rough roads while saving time due to the short distance. however, part of the rough roads were steep and unsafe for the vehicle. also the roads were a bit narrow and a bit scary because I felt traveling alone since I encountered no other vehicles using that route. I was like traveling a remote place. I wish you can make the app to give all possible routes so the user can chose what he feels best."
317970,"I'll keep using this since I trying to avoid google stuff as much as possible. The maps are decent enough but man the UX is horrid."
317971,"Over all really like the navigation and structure. However I can not get an address to navigate to..."
317972,"I can't navigate to anything. If I enter an address to route to it just says it cannot be found. Totally worthless."
