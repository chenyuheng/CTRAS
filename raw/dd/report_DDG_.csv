1,"This app is so bright it hurts. You're trying to read, write and relax, but the blank color scheme reminds me more of the sun hitting my face at 6am than of me relaxing while browsing.  This app doesn't have some sort of front page like imgur has for example, instead all we get is the ""discover"" feature which only promotes bland, vague and uninteresting posts with no personality. Just look at it right now! Where are the people sharing relatable stories, or video game strategies, or book or tv show reviews or something? All the posts featured there are just... unattractive, to say the least. And it's the only source of new content there is, otherwise you have to look it up manually.  There are no set categories or tags, instead you make them up and unless people type them up exactly like you did they won't see your post, which is counterintuitive and discourages finding new posts or bloggers.  People can disapprove or even edit your comments. That is twisted, discourages freedom of speech and opinion sharing and even allows people to literally put words in your mouth by changing your original comment to whatever they want.  You can't dislike posts or comments, so the voting system is pointless. You might think otherwise because Twitter and Vine have no downvotes,  but they promote discovery of new content in various ways, while WordPress does not.  The search bar doesn't work. I've tried finding my own posts with the exact same title they have and they don't appear.  All of these factors make it feel deserted and lacking of a community, and discourage new users of getting into writing or reading on WordPress. Also there used to be a eay to add a black outline to images; a necessity when the background is white.",,,,,,,,

3,"The only use for this app over google is it shows trails and jungle footpaths. After that its 'EFFING USELESS. The pointer spins constantly so you cant tell which way you're facing. It points 180 degrees out and the blue dotted line follows you, ie it can send you back the way you came and not leave your start point blank....so you still think youre going the right way as youre always attached to the dotted line. It should let the pointer move away from the dotted line, then you can see youre off course. If you brush the screen it opens a new dropped pin which then deletes the path you were following. I cant bookmark anything. Theres paths highlighted in red that i didnt add, it constantly directs you to road routes even tho i only want mountain footpaths and have it set to walking. It does work offline for me which is 1 reason not to boot it just yet but its useless to navigate with, i use it just to look for trails. Thankfully im not getting ads cos thailand auto blocks anything that isnt of profit directly to them. You need to disable the info sharing, apparently this app sells info on you 20 times more than other apps",,,,,,,,
4,"Voice guidance is awful: says keep right/left where I have to go straight, doesn't say exit numbers, doesn't say street names. Search is poor: shows the list, but how do I check these places on the map. I click the place and it shows my current location with the option to route to, but sometimes it shows the destination, go figure! No alternative routes, not optimal route, it can give the route which includes traffic lights, a couple of left turns instead of short residential road and right turn",,,,,,,,
5,"Problems, Problems, Problems! ------------ First when I installed the app & got some maps, they would disappear from the phone after each re-boot. So, I wrote to the developer. No reply after a month, I wrote back. No reply after two weeks. ------------- Next I uninstalled & re-installed the app (for the 12th time trying to fix the vanishing maps problem). Now the place in Settings to tell the app where to store the maps is gone. Gone! (The SD is 32 GB and has 31 GB free) I wrote the developer. After a week- no reply. ---------- Uninstall Warning: Each time I uninstalled the app., a large folder (Over 1 GB on mine) was left behind on the phone. One must use a file manager to delete it. --------- I Give Up (Which is too bad because this app is easy to use.) UPDATE- As shown below, the someone from the developer company posted suggestions. I had already tried (multiple times) what is suggested in the links the person posted. I also had already sent e-mails to the address shown. I will try one more time to contact them (because it looks like a fun & easy app). If no luck, I'll have to conclude that my phone and this app just won't play well together. UPDATE- Developer replied to this review and asked me for the name I used to contact them. I won't post my e-mail here. (That's not a comfortable thing to do.) I sent a new e-maill to them. I will update the review & star rating when (if) they reply & tell me how to make this application work.",,,,,,,,
6,"Its good, very useful for walking/hiking. Which OSM is very good for. Could  be better with search results for Car Navigation. OSM doesn't really  support proper Address searching so relying solely on this isn't possible.  I have to go back to Google to find actual full addresses. What I would  like to see changed is; - when searching the results show the downloaded  Map Name which can be confusing as it doesn't match the location of the  address. (please remove this) - would be nice to have other map  overlays/textures to choose from. (like osm where it shows house numbers!)  - Ability to sort bookmarks by Name rather than just when they were added.  (also when searching to show bookmarks in results) - Transport information  Trains / Bus times currently not available for the UK.",,,,,,,,
7,"I almost rated this for stars. It's a nice, useful app with some gaps--I really like the basic idea and the maps themselves are accurate and occasionally have nice details (for example, airport gate numbers).  There are some major gaps in searching for foods, shopping, etc., though. Primarily this is just in not having locations. For example, in one city in Japan I did a search for food and it came up with maybe 3 or 4 places when I was aware of dozens close by.  Since it pretty quickly looks for options further away, I was getting results up to fifty miles away (in Japan, traveling fifty miles can take several hours).  It also missed the biggest shopping center in the area.  Still, it's handy for knowing where you are and had the ability to download sections of the world's you're interested in.the interface is also easy to navigate and it came up with Japanese city names easily even though I was using English letters.  Train stations are well-marked and it's pretty easy to follow along with your reason trip to know how much further you need to go and where to get off (note that the routing itself i s by driving rather than public transport, which would have been a nice feature, but that you can simply see where the tracks are).",,,,,,,,
8,"Too many ads. Even more than Google Maps. At least most of the features work in a general sense; just not in my area.  EDIT: I understand that advertising is a resource that allows for development to continue, but you must understand the current default implementation makes any features very unappealing and the entire experience unenjoyable. I uninstalled imediately after the second push ad. Push ads are unacceptable in any form.  I am aware you can opt out of most advertising by going to settings and switching off ""Show offers"", but there's no garuntee your app will stop giving other unwanted push notifications, such as the one asking if the user is aware of the bookmarking feature. DO NOT engage the user outside of the app unless it is for a currently requested function or feature they are actively using, such as continuing navigation while in the background. There are better ways to let users know of features. For example, highlight the area you want to be noticed and give a brief message when the app is launched. This is more benificial for you as well, because a user is more likely to follow through when they have already chosen to engage with the app, as opposed to you trying to pull them away from whatever else they may be doing.",,,,,,,,
9,"I wanted to like this app. I'm looking for an alternative to google maps. The routing is actually ok, although the estimated timings don't take traffic conditions into account. The offline operation is good, but there isn't really an 'online' mode. If I currently have a good connection I want to be able to search a new area without having to download the section first. But what has killed it for me is that the search is useless. There us no UK postcode search, which is what I primarily use. Searching by street name sometimes works, but often comes up empty. Conversely when there are multiple matches adding extra location details (borough, etc) doesn't narrow the search effectively. As far as i can tell it treats each term entered separately and at some point if you haven't chosen one of the matches for your first term and keep typing it switches to searching on the second term, ignoring the first. I only managed to experience the navigation by finding places on Google maps, and then matching the street pattern and zooming to find them manually in this. I gather it works better in some countries than others, so I'll probably try it again sometime, but for now I'm giving up.",,,,,,,,
10,"The app is pretty handcuffed when compared with the web editor. The app lacks easy linking to already published posts, a way to copy a previous post, and the mouse support on Android is terrible - formatting buttons and most dialog boxes don't respond to mouse clicks at all. Basic interaction with the admin side, such as comment moderation and stats are fine, but for actually creating and publishing content, the app is very much a second class citizen compared to the web editor. Full integration of the web editor capabilities would make for a much better experience.",,,,,,,,
11,"This app becomes more and more idiotic. Stats are badly organized, slow and do not give relevant data. Posting and editing tools are worthless. This last stupid update is enough for me. Uninstall. Edit: I used this app for stats, and implementing ""Insights"" was bad! Loading is slow and with the last update you cannot view individual posts. New Wordpress post editor in a browser lacks a lot options, in app even more: options missing concerning pictures, buttons for formatting hidden... 500 limit",,,,,,,,
12,"What happened to the full editor??!!! Went to create a blog post today using my WordPress app and discovered that the editor is some weird, useless version of what it was before. I can't do anything in it like I can in the web based editor such as indent, center, size/place images, etc....literally every major function but basic typing is gone. Where did it go and how do I get it back? If this is not fixed I am uninstalling the app as it is totally useless to me without the full version of the editor. As well, the web based editor crashes EVERY SINGLE TIME I do an update to a blog. Makes editing virtually impossible. - - - I received an automated response to this review which said, ""You can switch back to the app's old editor: Go to App Settings in the app and toggle off the 'Show Visual Editor' option. However, some of the features you mentioned (such as indenting or aligning text) weren't part of the old editor, either."" - - - Found the setting. That leaves ONLY the HTML editor and does not fix the problem...at all. And, previously, before this change, the editor in my app and the web based editor were identical in their features.",,,,,,,,
13,"Inferior in every possible way to using the online editor. This app doesn't allow you to link to your own earlier posts, crashes often, can sometimes delet your whole draft even unsave a previously update and saved page, and has issues previewing images. It also cannot pull the most recent version of you updates which you created with the web editor. Woe be unto you if you mak long pots, because after a certain size copy/paste stop working and the editor gets so slow you have to wait for the displayed text to catch up to you. What it does do well is present your stats page, manage the site permissions and let you get a rough draft started. Though it has so many problems I'm just using the MS Office apps for my rough drafts and then copy/pasting into the web interface. I'll probably uninstall this soon because it is basically horrible.",,,,,,,,
14,"Adds have been added in one of the never versions, don't update if you haven't already! It's a good app, but it's NOT a universal map. It works best if you find your destination address with a browser, as the names in OSM don't always match. Due to size limits, searching by street numbers is not possible and this severely limits your options. The app goes nuts if your GPS is broken, and you can't just follow the route by moving the map with fingers, as popups keep reappearing. Maps.me is best if you just move to points you know in advance, using the best in class bookmark system",,,,,,,,
15,"Gallery creation/modification missing, Nexus 4 video upload doesn't work	On the whole, the UI is clear and nicely built, but two basics things I use most are missing/not working: - Creating a gallery necessitates first googling the workaround in their support forums (i.e. (1) attach multiple photos, (2) save as draft; this uploads images and links them to this post, (3) edit post replacing all code with just [gallery]; this uses all linked images (4) publish) - editing a gallery is impossible (just recreate using workaround) - uploading videos on my device doesn't work (invalid file type error), nor does the ""quick video"" function (can not retrieve media)",,,,,,,,
16,"Not as integrative as I would hope Three things plague this app for me. 1-You cannot upload on the featured image button, you have to do that on the main screen of the site. 2-You cannot get the edit post link through the app, have to log into dashboard on a browser. I need these links to submit post to my editor through Slack or Trello. 3-There is no word count visible. I need that since the sites I write for have a minimum word count. All three of these would make this a five star app for me, else it is useless for me and I might as well just write through the browser.",,,,,,,,
17,"It's worse sorry Since the last update I can't use my regular photo viewer to choose pictures from my post. I now have a list of images that seem to come from my tablet but not it's sd card; where all my images are. I have around 30,000 images in various picture folders (I am travelling and have a 128GB sd card in my tablet where my images are stored)  and this update to 3.9 has made choosing images impossible.  I have two possible workarounds. Either I upload the images to google or similar and put a link in the post to them. Or my second option is to upload the images in the WordPress app through the media menu item and then choose these images I want in the post using your new chooser interface.  Honestly I see what you are trying to do with the new interface but it does limit the user as to how they choose their images. Handing this task over to the operating system, as it was before, makes more sense and makes your app lighter.  Please switch back to the normal way of adding images. Updating posts on tablets and phones has been great with the WordPress app and I feel it's just been made more difficult with this update.",,,,,,,,
18,"The schedule is terrible. Going to event details and back resets your scrolling position. There are way too many events for this simple list representation and filtering doesn't help much. Search is a joke when you try to find a session because there are many of them with the same name and you have to go to details to see the time, the list is not sorted by time either. Shuttle bus schedule is missing from the app so you have to go to the web version to see it.",,,,,,,,
19,"I want to give it more stars because the site layout is nice and efficient, but editing posts is awful. The lag is absolutely unbearable. Trying to add a couple of characters takes 5-10 seconds to show up on screen. I've written part of a sentence and it's taken 30+ seconds to post them. Deleting them is even worse! I'm not even a fast typer on the text keyboard. It would be faster to handwrite everything at this point. Stick to the browser version for editing if this is why you want the app.",,,,,,,,

Unable to configure localisation of the map directory. Menu bar disappears at random? Navigation proposes routes violating the law and mistakes public roads with field roads.  After update navigation is much worse. No perspective view despite it is enabled in settings. Calculating a route is slow, arrival estimation changed from optimistic (below 4h) to pessimistic (over 8h) for a route Krapkowice-Warszawa (Poland, realistic estimate ca 5h). Rerouting freezes very often.  Figured out how to enable perspective view. I had to disable it, close the app, reopen the app and enable it. I fear of other bugs.",,,,,,,,
21,"Useful but to be improved. 1) it's missing a search field.  2) no multi select and upload of multiple images from a single folder, it's either messy all together or one by one. 3) I lost the whole text and images of a new post because of an internet connection error, this should not happen no matter how bad the connection is, offline editing is what users expect from an application vs the web-admin! 4) post settings button is hidden when keyboard is open 5) can't edit site url 6) can't batch upload local charges",,,,,,,,
22,"This app has gone downhill. Now that Google maps supports offline maps there is absolutely no reason to use this app. It still causes my device to restart. No other app makes my phone restart, only this one. It uses a dodgy background process that makes my phone restart even after I finish using app. They need to add a ""exit"" button to properly close the app. It keeps running services in background even when I force quit the app via task manager. It crams a lot of junk and annoyances in the app. I don't want business names or the ability to rate or share or whatever other junk they force in there. Let me turn all the junk off so I can use the map like a map. Stop asking me to turn on location settings. I use offline maps and not interested in going online and ""writing a review"" of map locations.",,,,,,,,
23,"I was really excited about this app when I first started planning a road  trip overseas. There are a lot of places I searched for to pin that the app  didn't find. It's search feature could use a lot of improvement. But the  deal breaker for me was found when I tried texting the offline navigation  in my home city the other day. I searched a location on the other side of  the city. The app only offered me one option for a route and, as a local,  it's not one that I would ever take - neither fastest nor shortest  distance. I started out on the route anyway and then purposefully deviated,  waiting to see how it would handle the route change. The answer is not  well. It directed me to turn around for the next several minutes even  though I was headed towards a major freeway, which was closer. If I'm using  this overseas and a road is closed for whatever reason, this app is never  going to help me get around the detour. Im going to have to figure it out  myself. Even after I got on the freeway, navigation continued to try to  route me off at the next several exits, which would have been way out of  the way. I'm super disappointed. Will definitely be trying another app  instead.",,,,,,,,
24,"Effectively useless for cycle routing. I downloaded this to get cycle routing which Google maps doesn't offer in Central America. Maps.Me does do cycle routing but it's effectively useless. First, it only offers you one route to your destination, so if you were thinking about taking another road, too bad, maps.me will not show you how long that road might be. You only get the one suggestion and no others, and no way to make it give you other options.  Second, there's clearly a compulsion by the app to avoid anything it thinks is a highway at all costs. So you end up with totally bizarre and out of the way routes when there's a direct road from you to your destination. This avoidance of highways would be ok if you were given more than one route to choose from, or you could turn off the 'avoid highways' preference. Unfortunately this is not possible. All of this might be fine in the US or Western Europe, but in Mexico and Central America if a road doesn't have a number (and is nominally a highway) it probably isn't paved. So avoiding anything with a number is basically going to be sending you along a lot of dirt roads. The app is also then also avoiding lots of rural highways, totally quiet, beautiful, no traffic, two lane roads.   Finally, they made a big deal with an update that made the app display an elevation profile for cycle routes too. This is a big deal for cyclists, as it's important to know the hills you have in front of you (or at least on the one route the app wants you to take). Sadly, this elevation profile is effectively useless too. The profile had nothing on it to show scale, so you have no idea how high the individual peaks are. There is one number given next to an up/down arrow symbol which I think must be net gain??? Or maybe it's total gain??  I really have no idea. And honestly, if you're going to give me one number, give me the highest altitude I'll reach on that route. From there I can guestimate the other climbs.  Maybe the app is ideal for driving. Maybe it works better for cyclists in cities. I don't know. I do know that it's pretty useless for me, except in the rare circumstances that the app and I are in agreement about which road to take.",,,,,,,,
25,"This app used to be perfect and previously helped me navigate around the world, but after updates these last few months, the app will no longer work offline. Unless I am connected to wifi, the app hangs on the preloading screen logo. Consequently, the app is now useless to me.

28,"App is so-so, value comes from the maps The application has a very limited feature set - basically the only thing that works (well) is showing the zero-cost OSM material. The app renders OK and quickly, but that is already all there is. Quite frankly, other apps based on the skobbler engine draw nicely and very smoothly. In many cases the offline cache of Google Maps is good enough (Japan) and in other areas Google Maps data can actually be downloaded explicitly for a defined region. There is massive room for improvement here.  [Adressing the response to the review: It is not that features are ""bad"". It is the lack of features which I am a bit unhappy about. Combine the (OSM data-driven) features of ""Locus Map"", ""GPS Navigation & Maps"" and ""MapFactor: GPS Navigation"" with the existing feature set and get a very nice app. Aggregate *more* data, make the OSM data more accessible, see for instance the email conversation we had three months ago. Just as an example - the Triposo applications have offline maps based on the (very nice) Skobbler engine. The data they aggregate is all crowd-sourced (i.e. of variable quality), but this app adds a tad bit more offline value.]",,,,,,,,

They say you should sign in to backup your bookmarks in a  safe place, but you can tap all day long on the sign in button, nothing  happens...

At over half a Gigabyte of app and mapping data, this app is just blatantly greedy, and the developers are either too lazy or too incompetent to design an app appropriately to store directly on exterior SD card storage. ----------- WHY do I have to download maps again following app update?

I just spent 20 minutes trying to enter in the address of a location.

In response to Developer's ""fixing"" the 2 missing EXAMPLE addresses I listed, that's like a drop  in the ocean. The problem is NOT simply that it couldn't locate the 2 EXAMPLE addresses I listed.

Now it keeps freezing on me if I touch any of the controls Search, Download Maps (I can download only by using the map itself), Settings at the bottom of the screen. Also some details (such as shops and bus stops are missing) and at least in one case a bus stop would show only at a specific scale. So I am only giving 3 stars right now but there is a great potential for an excellent app... PS. And I also like the fact they try to answer most of the reviewers when appropriate!",,,,,,,,

If I touched the outside of the text box, I couldn't scroll back down to continue my article, no scroll bar for text box. When I went to preview the article, it appeared as if it had posted it instead. So I pressed the back button to get back and edit, suddenly there was my home screen. I went back to the app and everything was gone",,,,,,,,
42,"Ever since the block editor was introduced, editing images and aligning it the way I want it to be is tough on my phone and I have to rely on my laptop for it. There's a particular layout I prefer and despite whatever tweaking I do, when the post is published, things aren't aesthetically how I want them to be. Earlier I had the freedom to just type stuff out and add images and publish it. Of course less options existed for formatting&alignment. The app is still quite user-friendly though.",,,,,,,,
43,"What's the point? I can log into my site much faster directly through the web than I can with the app. It's difficult to edit anything as the screen jumps around when you try to scroll. If there's a WYSIWYG editor I couldn't find it. It added formatting to a post I had started on my computer, which is funny because in the preview all the formatting is stripped. I'll stick with working directly via the web thank you.",,,,,,,,
44,"MALWARE APP!!!: IT SENDS YOU VIRUSES AND SPAMWARE Y 30 DIFFERENTE LANGUAGES, THE ANTIVIRUS DETECTS IT AS MALWARE, STAY AWAY!!! REPORTED !!!  I do not want popups asking me if I have thought about where I am going this weekend. Deleting it now. Remove this idiotic nonsense and I will reinstall and re-rate it.  also: CRASHES CONSTANTLY WHEN GOING TO SETTINGS. no audio instructions for turn by turn navigation? offline search is poor. download of maps extremely slow. Markers on map should be ordered by nearest to my location, etc. Markers search is poor, they re all scrambled.",,,,,,,,
45,"Just hate it... Not intuitive enough, I made couple of ""mistakes"" that got me headaches. First one, I started a post, and I wanted to save it, so I pressed the arrow in the up corner to acces next options, but that icon is a ""paper airplane"" that publish the post without even ask! Alright, first use... I search for something like post adjustments (oh, they were in the footer!), and changed the post to local draft. But it NEVER went to draft again in the blog!. Worst than that, I continued editing it, and the next time I accessed it, a message appeared, something like ""the post is not updated, do you want to?"" and I thought of course, upload the changes, but what it did was download the first draft (the published one) overwriting the last one so I completely lost ALL of my work. ""Well, let's see the revisions..."" but there's NOTHING like that. On top of all that, I searched the internet for help, and the only possible solution needed my device rooted before all this, and search some hidden directories, but it comes to happen that there are lots of people who doesn't even know what is to root an android device. ABSOLUTELY AWFUL!!!",,,,,,,,
46,I like the app and it works well for me to set things up . I have published an about me section and a blog post. It shows up on my end but when I try to view it externally it just says that a new wordpress site is coming. I just wish that when it's published on my end that it also publishes online. Now I have to figure out how to get my blog online so others can view it too.,,,,,,,,
47,Downloaded this app to use on a trip. It clearly said I had the offline map downloaded yet when I entered in the exact address or a category.. It said zero results found even though I knew the address was within my downloaded map. Poor experience. I reconnected with at a McDonald's and only then did the address show up. If this app requires you to have data then google maps is better.,,,,,,,,
48,"Downloaded thinking this will make mobile site management easier, which it may generally do. However, the first thing I wanted to do - upload a document to media - seems impossible (or unintuitive if I'm missing something). The 'add' buttons in the 'media' tab provides filters only for images and videos. There needs to be an option for any file type.",,,,,,,,
49,"For the last God knows how many months I have had no end of problems with this app. From not being able to upload photos, to my site being hidden when it's quite blatantly not, and not being able to start a new post, oy being able go into setting for about 5 seconds be for it puts me back to the main menu. Support advised reinstalling Jetpack, but that's not changed a thing. I'm giving it one last try. I'm not the only one having issues either. There's a few ppl I know who are having problems. No updates fix this.",,,,,,,,
50,"Samsung Tab 7,0 This review was done after using the app to leave Atlanta airport. **I do not recommend a buy on this app' but stick with the free version as the  major difference is the ability to search on this one, but it is not good and you essentially have the same features on both, free & Pro, with out it.  MapWithMe Pro has a nice mapping interface it works great on my 7.0, but *The app doesn't do navigation or street address search but merely shows you as a dot on a map which is the same as the free version. *The search feature add to the Pro version is very limited: not worth the money. * The Samsung 7.0 comes with, Latitude, for free and gives you the ability to download maps for offline uses and work just as good.  What I would like to see is point to point navigation and a more in depth search . If you drive into a GPS black out area a offline mapping system is nice to have limited uses to get you back on track.",,,,,,,,
51,"This app used to be great! Now it just crawls! I'm trying to plan a trip with various stops & I can't even get it started. I want to throw my device across the room! Very sorry it has gotten so unusable. EDIT. Finally the speed picked up, yet it tells me there is no way to get to certain towns where the road is clearly marked and Google Maps has no issue. They take no responsibility for routes not working because they are using some other company's maps. Removed.",,,,,,,,
52,"ZERO WYSIWYG If you enjoy squinting at your screen while writing in order to distinguish you article's text from HTML code, then you'll love this app. I must ask: If Evernote & every other goofy little writing app can display bullets, bold, italic, & other formatting as I am writing, why can't this tool for professional writers do the same? I enjoy the WordPress writing experience on my PC/browser because I can engage the content & the formatting directly, organically, while I'm creating. The only time I must face HTML is for the occasional media embed, etc. But with this app the HTML codes are scattered throughout the article & act like irritating little jolts from speed bumps as the appear in the paragraph I'm working on. So it's impossible to get into a state of ""flow! "" C'mon, developers, you can do better than this. I would gladly pay for a WYSIWYG WordPress writing tool. Until then, it's back to my PC for writing & editing my blog posts.",,,,,,,,
53,"Decent app. Tried out a few offline nav apps that use osm for data and this had the best looking map display for me. Clean and clear display during navigation a plus. Suggested nav routes were generally good, but did not care for the inability to ignore toll roads as well as to get more than one suggested route. The biggest shortcoming for me was that with just about all osm apps, the POI/address search are useless unless those items are entered in the osm database. A suggestion would be to have a online search function (like MapFactor's google search) to be able to find those items and be able to translate the info into an offline nav point. Another suggestion would be to improve the display functions during navigation, ie: speedometer/speeding warnings, lane assist, and fixed speed cameras. Needs improvements but a solid app overall.",,,,,,,,
54,Issues Downloading Maps to External Storage I installed the app and for several days have tried to download maps with routing for several US states. I used settings to download the maps to my external SD card. The app shows and says that maps or downloading/downloaded at first. If I exit the app and reenter. only a couple of maps now show as downloaded. Tried to uninstall/install several times and still does not work correctly. More stars when this major feature is working correctly.  Update: Giving you three stars due to quick response and concern! See my email to you with the requested info. Let's get this working together!,,,,,,,,
55,"I tried this app over a year ago and I couldn't get it to work with my domain. I decided to try again and this time it worked. I love being able to post at any time without being on my computer. The only issues I'm having are that I have yet to be able to upload a picture. I think this feature is worth one whole star. I tried uploading a picture on my provider network and over WiFi, neither worked. The other issue I'm having is that I can't seem to check categories for my post. I have to log in through my browser to do that. It may be user error but I couldn't find that option. All in all, it works for generic text posts - at least for me. I'll take that over NOTHING!",,,,,,,,
56,"Slow and broken for long distance travel. App slows randomly and takes forever to find a path. When you search for a location and see the name of the place you want to go to, you can't select until it loads all other relevant locations related to the query which wastes around 10 seconds. I'm using a PCT L29 Huawei phone for reference with the whole map downloaded with over 40gb of free space and no other application running. This is a terrible app. Use Google maps instead.",,,,,,,,
57,"It is okay but there are some issues with content being flat out incorrect. I've copied and pasted the given code to observe it's behavior into a text editor and it just kept throwing errors when the lesson insisted that I would get a certain result. Comments are disabled throughout the lessons I take meaning I can't contact them about it. If the writers of these courses can't give correct syntax, how am I supposed to learn? Also the built in text editor is glitchy.",,,,,,,,
58,"Absolutely Awful. As other reviewers have said, the app freezes up whenever I try to insert an image. I have a Samsung Note 10.1 and every attempt has locked my tablet. I attempted an uninstall/reinstall and the same problem occurs. The window also begins cutting off longer posts. The post is still there, but you will need to use your up/down buttons instead of the scroll function to see it. There is also no menu once you get to the post screen. Navigation between dashboard, post, and post options is difficult. I have been frustrated by the last several updates to this app. If you need to only post text, it isn't so bad, hence two stars. Any posts beyond simple, short text should be done online.",,,,,,,,
59,"Maps.me is usually better than nothing. Route planning is not the best. I could not drag a route to change it, and the app often refused to plan a route that ran near uninstalled maps. At one point, the route it chose added about an hour to a six-hour drive. The triangle icon indicating direction of travel often pointed perpendicular or opposite to the actual direction of travel, or ran alongside the road, or across open fields or bodies of water. Amusing on the autobahn, but a real pain when driving slowly or walking in a city center or small village. Gives very short notice for lane changes/exits. And unlike Google Maps which will say ""slight right"" or ""use right lane,"" this app tends to say only ""turn right!"" Which, again, is confusing. If you can use it, Google Maps is way better. But this did have the best interface/features of the various OSM-using apps that I looked at. I'd probably use it again, but only as the last resort.",,,,,,,,
60,"Edit 03.09.20: After nearly 10 years of using maps.me, I've finally switched to an open-source (GPL) OSM front-end, which has no ads, no forced updates, no commercial tie-ins, gives more control to the end-user (me!), and offers a richer useful feature set. Bye, and thanks for all the fish ...",,,,,,,,
61,"As other reviewers have mentioned, you can't search by address. For example, if your want directions to 12335 Fake St, the app will refuse. It will only let you plot a route to Fake St. If Fake St is more than a few blocks long, that's a huge problem. Also, you can't even search for an address until you download that region's maps. If you want to drive from NYC to LA, you have to download every map along the way before you go. Problem is, most maps are named after smaller towns, not big cities.",,,,,,,,
62,"Very frustrating. Wanted to start by organizing menu items because an apple user showed me how easy it was. Android app, I find out, has no option in the app. After meeting with the other user, we find out I have to go to ""independent publisher 2"" and get redirected to the browser. There, we find ""menu"" but am unable to open the items I create. Unable to delete items because tapping on the arrow drop down button on the right only works 1/1000 times. Not user friendly. Disappointing app experienc",,,,,,,,
63,"I need to edit this review, the most valuable feature of the app were the widgets and they simply don't work!!! The values are not getting any update!! The new today widgets are missing the title of the blog. This was a nice feature on the old widgets, light and dark themes are not wnought to identify the blogs. The widget does not keep the size, from time to time I have to expand them. When clicking on the today widget I expect to go to today, this was the default behaviour of the old widgets.",,,,,,,,
64,"So inaccurate and unreliable! It was the cause of MUCH frustration when walking in Barcelona and Seville. It seems to perform better in cities laid out on a clear grid but beyond that, it's pretty useless. I absolutely would NOT use this app for driving navigation. To be specific, the location arrow is very slow to respond and it often indicates the opposite direction of actual travel. Next, t here seems to be a 'sweet spot' for reading the street signs when zooming in to pinpoint location.",,,,,,,,
65,"Editor is missing not even half the functionality as the one in the web browser. You can't even add a heading or set the font size. The only way to do it is by going to the HTML editor and add a tag that way. The only good thing about this is being able to manage posts, pages and comments (move or remove them). If you want to edit posts or page on your phone or tablet, you're better to do it another one and copy + paste it in using the web browser admin panel.",,,,,,,,
66,"Grateful for this app and love how I can load media from phone direct to gallery. (pls allow access to the WP image gallery from the desktop version). Also Widget on stats is great. -Wish writing functionality was better. And on few occasions the App version threw off main version from Laptop. I had to rebuild post for hour.

67,"Blacklisted me? I tried logging into my WP site, once, using this app while on my home wifi but it couldn't connect. Now my home network is not allowed to load the page at all, from any browser from any device. The server doesn't respond to my IPs request to view the page. I can only load the site using other networks so I have to go to a friend's place or public wifi. I tried using the app to log on using my mobile data and now my mobile IP is blocked too. Very troublesome. I've contacted support.",,,,,,,,

70,"Gets worse. Bloated, huge map files suddenly  etc Before you could download maps without the navigation. I love having a lot of maps of countries I'm not traveling to.  Same also for the traffic info, hotel bookings etc. I paid then for the pro version and I get trash. Pity as it used to be perfect! Now it gets stuck often is slow and buggy. Apart from it there is a persistent bug with search. I search a place and I get a point that I bookmarked before in the area instead of what I'm looking for. After a few tries suddenly it may give me the real place.",,,,,,,,
71,"The update buried the feature I use most in the app This app was great until the last update. The part of the app that I used the most was the admin page access. It was always the first thing I looked at whenever I opened up the app.     I maintain several WP sites for myself, both business and personal. I use the app for when I don't want or have time to sit down at my pc to do updates.      Where I thought the app shined was maintaining my WP sites. The app allowed me to be able to easily cycle through all my sites quickly to see if they needed plugin or WP updates. After selecting the admin option, I could click each site and within minutes have all the sites updated, significantly quicker than using a pc to do it.    With the latest update to the app, the developers buried the admin page access 3 clicks deep, so what would take me 1 click + a click per site to check update status, now requires me to click into the settings, then 2 clicks per site to check for update status.    I considered this app a 5 star app before this bizarre change. I'm hoping it was an oversite or test on the developers part and that they'll fix this in the next update.  Otherwise, at least in my opinion, they've partially crippled the app.",,,,,,,,
72,"App only for big cities like london, delhi etc. Mostly lines only available without name. Shown Only one navigation route, though many alternate available. Pros 1. Less data and less battery usage 2. Big cites data available 3. Make our own bookmarks, location etc Cons. 1. Complete map data available only for large cites. 2. Suburban, minor cites name only included If your moblie has enough space, google offline is better. Not suitable for travellers through small cities villages etc.",,,,,,,,
73,Formatting is lost each time I exit post view after editing. Upon returning  to the post it appears as one solid block of text with all styling removed.  Issues with Grammarly's inline word correction appearing as a question mark  icon in the WordPress Mobile post editor.

It seems the content blocks don't translate well to the  mobile editor,,,,,,,,
74,"For an official app of one of the most popular blogging platform on the internet, it's not very friendly or responsive to changes on the web version. One, none of my pictures could be uploaded to the media, and two, deleted websites still remained in the list until I finally figured out how to remove them, yet it didn't do it cleanly. Never changed for years, probably will uninstall finally.",,,,,,,,
75,"Hated it! This used to be a really nice app until I got the latest update. It's slow, loads very few posts on the reader and when it hangs while I'm using it, other people can't access my site! I simply hate and I advice you not to update your app if your still using the old version.  . . Oh, and another thing, you can't view all your followers and the stats area is just complicated and useless. They have also removed the widgets area",,,,,,,,
76,"Fine for pedestrians, problematic for driving. i've used this to get around by foot several times, with no notable problems except that it continually resets ""north is up"" view every time the screen turns on (which agitates me to no end). While driving, though, its voice volume is too low to hear above ambient background noise (GMaps has an extra voice volume booster for this), it almost invariably waits until a navigation point is directly beside you before telling you about it (""turn left... behind you""), and it often picks a far-out-of-the-way route when a straight line would work just fine. i used this on my last trip by car and it ended up costing me an additional 25%+ driving distance because of voice delays and truly curious navigation choices. The only strong argument in favor of this app over gmaps is its ability to be used  completely offline.",,,,,,,,
77,"Frustrated that Google Maps only shows restaurants nearby. This appears to have the same distance limit in restaurant searches- it only shows restaurants as far out as a mile or so. There was also a text box advertising it's subscription service that loaded on open. Google maps has offline maps and a Share feature. This is, as far as I can tell, the exact same material I get using the free app that I wanted this to replace.",,,,,,,,
78,"Doesn't search by postcode, the three locations I tried came up with no  results (the locations have been there for over 20 years), then when you  search for the actual road names and find them, the area it lists them in  is usually wrong, so you'd have to really know where you were heading  before you trusted it. The app also seems to only give you one route  choice, no option to change to quickest or shortest in the settings, or  avoid motorways etc. Can't really comment on much else as I gave up after  learning those things. All in all it's basic, the navigation is competent  but very sensitive to kinks in a road (so be prepared to bear left / right  a lot when you're just following a road). My advice is to use Navmii which  isn't perfect, but light years ahead of this.",,,,,,,,
79,"First, you should be able to enable all POIs along your route. It would be really helpful to see gas stations or restaurants without having to search for them. MapPoint has this feature and it works well. Second, is night mode. It saves power and is easier on the eyes. Third, is a navigation view instead of the typical overhead view. And forth is voice guided navigation. The map files seem to be large too (compared to other offline mapping apps), any way you can make them smaller?",,,,,,,,
80,"Change their business model to a subscription. I purchased this app for all my devices Android and iOS. At the time there where no additional fees, ads or subscriptions. Now this app has ads and to get rid of them you have to pay a monthly subscription. They changed the rules in the middle of the game, I'm deleting it from all my devices. This app works offline after you download maps. Searching for an address is not good. You can import KMZ files, such as places you've mark in Goolge Maps.",,,,,,,,
81,"Disappointing The big plus is the offline use of maps and the maps that look good. On the downside: we disagree on the fastest route. On first use it misses a connection to a highway and suggesting a longer route. Then the app even tries to send me back three times unnecessary, making the journey even longer. Vocal directions are ambiguous compared to my regular Garmin nav and compared to Google. Maybe it's just the dutch language. At times the GPS update seems out of sync with the actual location. Good as a backup nav.",,,,,,,,
82,"I use the app for offline map viewing. When trying to plot a route, I couldn't untill updating the maps. This shouldn't be the case, and very annoying if you're abroad and roaming.

83,Lacking options When adding an image to a post I cant set alt text or remove the link off the pic... this app is pathetic. It has so much potential yet too little effort has been made :( can't even view the html editor to remove the link and change alt text. This forces me to use the full site which has a very poor mobile interface... To the guy bellow defending this app: I am so sorry your site is so basic and your SEO so poor that this app is acceptable by your apparently low standards.,,,,,,,,
84,"Expecially after the updates of the last months, the app shows issues that make it not usable:  -it cannot make a path on a map not updated (and if you are abroad without Internet and unlucky enough to miss the update, you cannot use the app, which denies the usefulness of it); -you cannot zoom on the rough map if you do not download the detailed map first, so you cannot get an idea of zones you did not download (not even the zones that are clearly visible on the rough map when not zooming); -full of pop-ups and messages you cannot remove, covering the map and being extremely annoyng; -the ""search"" option is horrible, sometimes cannot find even extremely famous places (try searching ""San Marco"" in Venice...).",,,,,,,,

91,"Even though I tried this with different keyboards it's editing capabilies are poor.   They don't come up to any of the external editors that I have on my tablet.   Compared to the pc/web version this is crippled.  One reason I would like an external editor is that I have a lot more formatting capability and the ability to 'snapshot' or, for example, undo deletions.  rather than sweat coding more editor functions, simply flipping into an more capable external editor seems sensible.  There are a lot of management features in the PC/web version that I consider very basic.  being able to edit the raw HTML code to correct errors or carry out formatting that the 'visual' mode doesn't permit is one.   Again, this might be resolved with an external editor: edit in visual/text or in html switch.  Perhaps the simplest demonstration of what's lacking is to run the tablet and the PC/web version side by side.  I realize there is a screen real estate issue, especially when trying to run this on a 4.5 inch phone, but perhaps that's a case of ""you shouldn't be doing that"".

For example I put in directions to Sloquet hot springs. The route the app selected is a very rough road compared to the parralel road that also gets you there. It would be nice to select other roads with the touch of a finger. Please improve and get back to me. Thanks for the prompt response on my last review",,,,,,,,
94,Introduces one to a world of interesting people. I like the app but wonder sometimes why WordPress suggests that I share posts on social media to increase views when I have done so to several sites the day before and had multiple comments and likes on those sites but WP shows me having less than one-third as many views or worse. People follow my blog or like a specific post but somehow there are no views that day. The notifications are useful but sometimes seem inaccurate.,,,,,,,,

98,Terrible image management This app is flat awful and unusable for a blog with images. First you have to insert a photo into a post to get it into your media library. Then you have to select the same photo to be the featured image. BUT then the post will show the SAME photo twice! So you have to delete the photo from the post and leave it as the featured image for the post to look normal and not retarded.

I already tried to unsinstall and reinstalled it but still the same. I also clear cache and clear data but it did not help. It is not loading only black screen when I try to open. After that it shows error to send report to developers.,,,,,,,,
100,Big issue. I have this big issue that Is very poor of this app... I was driving and it took me through footpath though on car and I got stuck on the way and had to leave my car and continue on foot since I didn't have any other option... I suggest you integrate Google maps in this app because it can't find some locations like my church. I had to use Google maps and bookmark it in this app before I couldn't get lost anymore but the other problem is it deleted the bookmark without my permission..,,,,,,,,
101,"I installed this app in the hope of avoiding google maps. In favour: map quality is excellent. Bookmarking places isn't very intuitive, but the real failure is lack of routing understanding. In the UK an app like this should have settings that create *sensible* route choices; nothing I found stopped it trying to send me from Wiltshire to Kent via central London. On paper the route looks ok; in the real world it involves a congestion charge and would take forever (subjectively). More work needed.",,,,,,,,
102,"It's okay. I'm not a big fan of this app overall. The layout on my tablet leaves a lot of negative unused space, if you put the options icons on the left and had a view of your feed/blog on the right it would greatly improve upon that. I do not like how you can not preview or view any blog, I think its a bit absurd that I have to use my browser to actually see my blogs. I also noticed you can not add/create a new blog on the app, I would have to do this in the browser as well and reload my account into this app for the new blog to appear in the drop down. Over all the app is visually appealing, quick and operates effeciently on my tablet, but the missing features completely deture me from keeping this app when I can probably find a compatible blogging app that suits my needs more. Or just use my browser. I'll check back later and redownload if improvements are made, I am a fan of wordpress but this app is nearly useless as is.",,,,,,,,
103,"Unintuitive I was using this app to walk around Munich, but it was often difficult-to-impossible to see the name of the street I was on. I wanted to use it offline and without using my location (to save battery), but the app constantly prompted me to switch on location. There's a bug in the bookmark view, it's difficult to edit the bookmark for items with a lot of details, it will snap to the bottom or top, and the ""edit"" button is in the middle. Also, navigating the app in general is unintuitive.",,,,,,,,
104,"In my opinion, there is no search feature and the Discover section does not quickly adapt to my interests. What a terrible app! I understand that it might be meant to be used in conjunction with the website, but that model is irrelevant in today's smartphone-driven world. I don't know who clapped each other on the back in the back office for creating this app, because once again, in my opinion it is terrible and they should get some BA's on the job quickly!",,,,,,,,
105,"This latest version changed my default map location from SD card to main memory, then told me I didn't have enough memory to update my maps, although this version only updates changes. I then had to download my maps again after changing the location, as it STILL doesn't recognise that I already have downloaded maps!  Just to add that I have used maps from my sdcard correctly for a few years now!  This rating only applies to the latest version which screwed up my configuration. This forced me to re download maps that are already on my sdcard, as even after changing the location back to the sdcard, the app still didn't check for the existent of valid maps in the selected location.",,,,,,,,
106,"It's mostly OK. This cannot fully replace the web dashboard. But I think it is OK as a mobile companion app. You can do all basic tasks, like managing your blogs, notifications, comments, etc. with this app. I just wish it could upload multiple media files. A separate html mode in post editor would be very great. It also has upload problems from time to time. Would be great if those can be added/fixed :-)",,,,,,,,
107,"I have published a blog post one week ago on my computer and today I  decided to start writing a new post on the mobile app. I suddenly saw the  blog post that I have already published and shared it on all the social  media accounts in the draft section. I was confused so I clicked on it.  When I clicked on it the draft from one month ago opened, the post without  any pictures and half of the text missing. I thought that it was super  weird so I checked it also on the computer and the original post that was  already published was gone, I could only found the draft. My heart stopped  and everything was lost. Thank god that the whole article was posted to my  email when it was published so I could just copy paste everything. The app  is not refreshing and updating the posts that are already published so I  will not use it anymore.",,,,,,,,
108,"Navigation is available only from your current location, you cant set another starting point for a route there is - NO route options for a route - like in google maps.  I found one app which has this and offline maps and for moment is free which i recommend after I have spent a afternoon with install and test of famous and good rated apps like Telnav, ex Skobler, Sygic, GPS Navigation from Bzing s.r.o. ex. Be-on road which miss basic function like the one mentioned before",,,,,,,,
109,Good but missing Custom Post Type support. I add CPTs into most of my sites and only being able to update blog entries is very limiting. Image handling is a bit buggy. Really good when fixing typos or creating quick posts. The earlier versions of this app were way more functional.,,,,,,,,
110,"I've been using Maps.me for about a month now as a backup to my Garmin as I travel around Europe. It does a decent job of helping you navigate around city's. However it is borderline useless when navigating great distances. It only offers one route and it is always the most direct route. That means if the most direct route is through the center of a massive city as supposed to using a ring road. It's taking you through the city. This has happened to me a few times while using maps.me and since I don't know the area it's bitten me in the ass almost everytime. Something that would take 30min using the ring roads instead takes 2hrs because you have to go through the whole city. It also has a very hard time rerouting. Several times I followed the road signs instead of the app and it refused to reroute, it didn't even reroute a turn around. It just kept spinning the map in circles. Like I said for city nav it's not bad, Google maps is better but this is a decent no data options. But for long drives I'd avoid this app.",,,,,,,,
111,"Clunky I have no idea how this has a 4.6 star rating. There's no importing of favorite places. Very unintuitive to set your favorites like home and work. Not user friendly to navigate to your favorites. The voice is very unnatural sounding. Turn directions do not include street name that you're turning onto. Distances read out in feet instead of miles (""turn left in 3000 feet"" vs. 1/2 mile). Finally, it's worse than Google maps about unnecessarily telling you to keep left to stay on the interstate at off ramps.",,,,,,,,
112,"The app could use some work. It's great for when I'm away from my laptop, but some customization features aren't present in the mobile app and there's a formatting glitch that makes posting difficult. I cannot customize my message, write an excerpt, or customize my slug when on the mobile app. I'd love it if I could. The formatting glitch happens every time I have to go back in my writing and add or delete sentences. It will change all previous text to headings. Pretty great otherwise.",,,,,,,,
113,"The app regularly crashes as I type. It freezes and grinds to a crawl just as often. The app fails to recognize letters as I type them and it deletes spaces after words. A solution is to work in html mode. It appears that these bugs are only an issue when you have images display while editing a post. The more images, the worse the problem. It seems unbelievable that WordPress, with its QA resources, can't fix these issues.",,,,,,,,
114,"Pixel 2 (Stock Android) Feb/2019: Looks promising but app rarely works properly. Even while traveling abroad, Google Maps Offline worked great but MAPS.ME Offline did not work at all - couldn't even find my location, let alone use navigation.

116,"Could have been better Purchase the Pro version because sometimes internet/Google Maps is not always accessible. The maps looks good at first glance, especially it has street number in the map. The most unbearable problem so far is the poor searching function: tried to find a certain address but the map can not actively find the exact location and re-center the map to the target location. Moreover, it seems that the app does not recognize the address at all and do nothing. If you can not even search an address then this maps in a sense is crippled. My cell phone is LG G3, Android 4.4.2, had already loaded with the maps used for address searching.",,,,,,,,
117,"One of the most problematic and difficult apps on my device.... This is even more unfortunate, since millions of users out there trust and use worpress - while this weak app is the only real smartpgone tool available to access your site.

I have already contacted support and forum - without an answer....",,,,,,,,

You can download just the areas you need to your internal or external storage and always have access (the KitKat external SD ""sandbox"" is supported).  The map will follow your position if you have location enabled.  One serious flaw is the inability to interpret address info being sent from other applications, so you can't use this application as your default map.  Links from calendar, e-mail, and browser apps will just go to the middle of the ocean near Africa at Lat/Lon 0/0).  Another issue is cross-map routing: you can't plan a route across state or country boundaries that cross map files.",,,,,,,,
119,"Uber detailed maps, search needs tinkering By far the most detailed mapping, right down to stores, plazas, schools, even addresses along main roads. That said, the search and location save features need some work. Even saved locations wouldn't show on search, whereas HERE pops it up as soon as a similarity is detected, along with nearby options for food and services - and saving and renaming was a bit awkward. A cleaner color scheme choice would be awesome. The yellow tint in this map is awful with a screen filter.",,,,,,,,

I supposed you would need to enter the hotel name in Japanese in order for the search to work. Google map works wonder using English. I wonder if I can get a refund.

I do understand you are doing fraud here - sell application to make it add-free, then make it free and return adds back to get money from advertisers after you got money from customers which wanted to remove adds.

If you want to use it I suggest saving every sentence unless you really enjoy retyping. Annoyingly this also closes the post, so you have to constantly go back into edit mode. Thank goodness I have the keyboard dock. Also, adding photos does work, and it lets you set alignment, but it doesn't seem to be able to properly type text to flow around those images, so using Alignment None is really the only option.",,,,,,,,

130,"In general is a good app, but there are some issues. From the phone, if you have older posts, you can't switch to the editor block. With the phone app you don't have the same options in the editor block as with a PC. So, if you edit an older post on the phone you have to go to the computer to add that specific element.

140,"As a cyclist I have to say that this is the only app so far that I have checked that allows you to create routes using small roads that doesn't crash or fails for some random reason or has them all removed; google maps, strava, osmand, bike citizen, here we go, sygic maps, all of them failed spectacularly, this one did not.  However the real problem is that I am unable to create anything but short routes due to the limitations in the amount of stops that I can add; given there are tons of forest roads you can never pick the one you like and make something longer than 30km of a route; It also isn't even a paid feature, I'd have paid for such feature in a heartbeat.  Two fixes, having 3 stops is ok if I can chain routes, as in save them and load them quickly; or allowing to add up to 10+ stops, the average that you need on 80+km rides on these forest mazes.  Back to square one having to buy a GPS, and these garmins aren't cheap at all; I am however pleased on how close this was to actually work, that I dared to write this review; hoping they implement it, even if it's paid; maybe they can have competition in something they never expected to.",,,,,,,,

It should search only in the city you are at. If it had google's map search engine like, this would be definitely the best offline app for maps.  And it is not possible to add a city name with the street you are searching. As soon as you start typing more letters all the results disappear and a weeping dog appear saying ""no results"".

Guys, I really like the app overall, but the cursor was jumping around while replying to comments today, I have a hard time liking posts & commenting at times, and I would really love to see it function without switching to web & prompting me to login just to like, follow, or comment.  Also, it is difficult to follow others that have followed me without having to go to web, login, find them again, etc. There are also places where the text gets cut off, like in stats & when viewing Gravatar.",,,,,,,,

They couldn't have for this app because it flat out does not work!   I read all the glowing reviews about this app and decided to buy it.  Bad choice!  If you live in the U.S. and plan to use this app offline to find street addresses it won't work. Period.  I tried several addresses in the metro area where I live and it found none of them!  It will sometimes find the street name but if there are several streets with the same name it will list them all and you somehow have to figure out which, if any, is close to what you're looking for.   And, Google, wonderful company that it is (not!) gives you a whopping 15 minutes to try out the app and get a refund if you don't like it.  At minute 16, it's yours forever!   How does a company like Google succeed, with business practices like this?!!  Horrendous!   If you expect this app to work anything like Google Maps or Mapquest, forget it, don't buy this app!",,,,,,,,

164,"It's fine. It seems unfinished sometimes. The lack of street names in the voice navigation makes it hard to use for navigation unless you have someone with you to be the navigator and tell you what the app is showing. The lack of street names also makes it unusable for navigation on my motorcycle where I depend solely on the voice prompts. To clarify, the streets were named in the app, and they even flashed across the top of the screen, they just weren't spoken in the voice prompts.",,,,,,,,

The end results can be great if you are patient, but the whole interface is just painful, and I end up putting off updating my blog because I know it is going to be a hassle. There seem to be so many different areas to the app, all of which allow you to edit a post for example, but each with a slightly different interface and different features and options. Yesterday I was previewing a post, found a mistake so clicked edit and went into a completely different editor, which allowed media insertion direct from hard drive rather than having to upload to library first. And now I can't find it. Could be great but is too messy and bitty.

I reported this over 6 months ago, but the issue remains. 2) Navigation stops working if you turn off the screen. Leaving the screen on continuously burns through way too much battery to make this feasible during travel...despite this being a travel-oriented app. 3) As soon as you start navigating, the compass stops working (arrow no longer shows your orientation). They claim this is ""by design,"" but it is unlike all other map/navigation apps, cannot by disabled via options, & makes it impossible to know which way you're facing without stopping & restarting navigation",,,,,,,,
176,"Really great and helpful app, I'll recommend it for anyone. I also love that it saves work automatically even if you phone shutsdown.

If a blog has comment moderation enabled, and then an administrator replies to  (and thereby approves) a comment which is ""pending moderation"" from within this app, the comment author will never get the reply notification email.   This is because this app appears to somehow bypass the `wp_set_comment_status` hook when administrators reply to a ""pending moderation"" comment within the app. The `wp_set_comment_status` hook is what fires the reply notification emails for many comment subscription plugins.  There is a clue that the developers know of this bug (I do see it as a bug) because, in this app, an administrator can ""Reply"" to comment that is pending moderation, but in the regular WP Admin interface, the button is labeled ""Approve and Reply"" not just ""Reply.""  I hope this gets fixed as it would be great to use this app to approve and reply to comments, and fire the `wp_set_comment_status` hook so that comment authors can receive email notification of the replies.",,,,,,,,

Another alternative would be for you to give meaningful diagnostic answers so we can all benefit from solutions found and discussed here.  Terrible support model going on here.

The only way to fix hung uploads is to delete it and then browse through your photos again to try once more. This is a huge burden when you upload 20 photos and 5 of them hang. This behavior is consistent whether on wifi or data. What's more, the only intuitive options for a poat are ""local draft"" or ""publish"". I can't get the app to default to ""draft"", in which it is uploaded and able to be edited on my computer. Even if I only have the app as a way to upload cell photos, it is almost worthless at that.",,,,,,,,

228,"Voice guidance during driving is not as good as on Google Maps, e.g. no ""turn left, then turn rught"" if next turn is immediately after current one. No voice advice and no sign like ""use the 2nd lane to turn right"", if 2nd is better to, e.g. turn left then. Streets that I don't need to use for my way are hardly visible during navigation which makes harder to compare map to actual turns on my way and consequently makes harder to define whether actual turn I approach is the one map talks about or it's the next one. Please don't hide turns that are not part of the route! Until that I prefer other navigation apps. Text on the map made adjustable - thanks.",,,,,,,,

Second: while driving the application is very keen on directing you to a motorway. Once decided which motorway to us, the app is willing to direct you a few miles in the wrong direction instead of choosing the shortest/fasted link. Also I noticed that is does direct you to closed roads (andosm use the same maps not having this problem).

This is the primary reason for 1 star rating. - Car navigation is so bad it's practically useless  PROS: - Good offline map support for when you visit countries where you have no service so long as you do not need navigation - Maps include hiking trails which is very useful if you're hiking national parks and you want to check where you are on the trail. The hiking trail maps are actually better than Google's.",,,,,,,,

255,"""Best App of 2014""? I'd sure hate to see the worst! I'm guessing the reviewers who rated it #1 tested it exclusively in one state because this GPS app can't even cross map boundaries. If you want to go from Burbank to Las Vegas, you'll have to set up the California portion, then a separate Nevada portion. Unbelievable. Selecting a destination is an awkward process that involves manipulating the map. Sheesh!

266,"severely flawed app I was favorably impressed with the quality of the maps that came with Maps with Me Light; so, I ordered the full version.  However, I found that full version severely flawed. While the program correctly identified my being at my home, and while it correctly identified the name of the street I was on, when I tried to search for my full address, including the house number, it could not find the address and suggested similarly named streets in other towns. When I asked for the Walgreen pharmacy, it identified such pharmacies in distances of over 4 miles, but failed to identify the pharmacy that is less than half a mile from where I was. When I asked for restaurants, it failed to identify the 99 Restaurant two blocks away from my home, while identifying another restaurants offer the same chain, several miles away.  In my opinion, the application completely failed the test. If I were in an unfamiliar city, (which is the point of a mapping application), I need to find the nearest gas station, ATM, pharmacy, or a specific address. If I cannot rely on Maps with Me to do that, I have no use for it. I have requested cancellation of my purchase.",,,,,,,,

And when visiting someone's blog, I prefer seeing an outline of their posts, which can help me access ANY post of that person, over an incomplete list of posts sorted chronically which doesn't display all of their posts (some of them are only accessible on the app through browser, so what's the point of using the app over browser?)",,,,,,,,

Mapswithme, on the other hand, is mighty fast but lacks in map data quantity, quality and the fact that the search function is useless. The only way I've found it useful is to search for the street only, but even then you have to magically deduce which city it's located in by the distance from your position alone. It's not very precise, also. In addition, i haven't found a way to change the measurements to km's, so that's that.  Last, but not least - there's no decent navigation (the rotation of the screen doesn't count).",,,,,,,,
294,Good but there is some issues I have with it 1. The spacing can be annoying when you make a long post it does not goes down it just stays up you have to make it go down. 2. You should be able to edit categories in the app odd you cant. 3. You should be able to change the url for free atleast 1 time sucks you cant. 4. Increase the GB size from 3 to 5.,,,,,,,,

I'm still unimpressed with the changes to the interface but I can live with that.  Original review: SGS III with Android 4.3. Uploading a post from my phone since the update results in an error notification 80% of the time. And yes I am logged in to my Wordpress account,  Also, the new interface requires more steps just to send a simple post as the post settings have been moved to a separate page for no apparent reason.",,,,,,,,

Just in the last week of a weeks long European vacation it has started to lag badly. We start to walk the route and the blue arrow doesn't move and then it suddenly jumps to catch up. This is even when we are out in an open area on a street. This was a great app and we really depended on it especially to find our accomodations in the historical parts of towns.

If the place you want to go to is not recognized, the app shows you a cartoon fox... With a shoe... Probably, it means something deep, but it would be easier to say 'sorry, can't find it'. And again, why not? Even with an internet it's impossible to create a route. Also, all fancy features 'photo spots'," 'nightlife' etc. work only for a very limited list of random cities. Didn't find it helpful or reliable."""

Alas - no one came back to me. Here is my original bug report:  1 - the maps are very good, with very aesthetic and appealing view. Kudus! 2 .- I have received few times failures in planning a walk, and was advised to define a different start or end point.  I fail to understand both. 3. There is a very unstable behavior you need to solve. When walking along a planned path, even a very straight one, the view keep rotating clockwise and back. This is annoying behavior. 4. When walking along a plan path, the software does not take care to move the visible map window, therefore I have to take care of this. 5. It should be possible to decide which data layer is drawn. For example, when I look for a monument and the search can not find it and I want to finger choose it, I don't want to see icons of restaurants. 6. There should be integrated icon explanation. 7. I would expect a search that yields many results to sort them from close to far. In 99% of cases I need the closes",,,,,,,,

If you need to find a particular street number forget it, best it can do is tell you the cnr of x and y. For roads that are 20-30km long it is worthless for navigating to a particular street address. I have to whip out google maps to get that last 1km or so. The addresses work best when you put them in backwards, even when you select the search on map option in search. It's just a mess.

Repeated clicking in & around the line I want the cursor to be gets it there & then makes it jump back to two lines above or where ever it wants to be. Also editing code to existing posts messes things up.  Currently only thing the app is good for is approving/deleting comments.  When commuting & wanting to create a new post I now use blogger, because unlike this app, it just does the job.  Please fix/improve! I've been with wordpress for years & love everything else about it!  device: Galaxy S II",,,,,,,,
360,"Great before the upgrade I upgraded the app earlier this morning and now I am unable to save any posts with or without pictures.  Please fix this!   4:54pm Update: The error message says ""an error occurred when loading media: no peer certificate"" I took the pictures out and it still doesn't save to draft or publish. It says local changes.  I lost an entire blog post today of over 500 words because of this upgrade. I have never had an issue with this app since I originally downloaded it. Please correct this!",,,,,,,,
361,"I'm very disappointed with this app as WordPress is supposed to be the leader for blogging. Can't save a draft just on the device when there's an internet connection. Can't create a post draft with pictures when offline. No control of the layout of photos when using ""Tiled Gallery"" and no preview of such posts. Unable to set geo-location for a post. This bug has been there in over a year and still hasn't been fixed.",,,,,,,,
362,"Always hangup on me. Not realiable I bought this maps with me pro. I kinda like  but it always hung up on me. There are times when you change course and you did not follow the recommended route, after awhile it abruptly closed. There are times that it will closed automatically without apparent reason. We had to restart it several times in order to make it work. It's so frustrating in the middle of the navigation and you are kinda lost and this will closed automatically.  I am using samsung galaxy note 3 for this apps. I am so frustrated.  Reloading is not a good answer. I paid for this. I expect a better answer or another solution.   FYI - Reloading is the next thing that I ever did once it's abnormally closed but it takes several reloading before it will be usable. Do you have an email add where I can stage my complain?   I did. I send an email to you last Jan 9 until today, I haven't received any reply.",,,,,,,,
363,Nice UI update...but... The UI update was a long time coming...  Still no option to hide the stats section that is useless to self hosted sites.  Dashboard is just the web version?  Wth?  Media section displays blurry thumbs.  Doesn't seem to have been tested out before releasing.  Editing pages/posts is a terrible experience. Offers nothing for the seasoned users.,,,,,,,,
364,"Has a lot of maps but takes forever to download relatively small files. Also constantly saying failed download on this app. What should be simple is a pain in the butt. I switched from here maps to this because this app has more countries available, but I feel like Im trading more countries that here maps doesnt have like japan but with a less quality app. I like the maps on here maps better too. Oh well, Ill give it a continued try and see only because ive invested all this time in it so far",,,,,,,,
365,"Please add a speed limit option. In Japan, many people use scooters. 50cc. The max speed limit is 30km/h. So when I search a route using your app, it's always the wrong estimated arrival time. That kinda sucks. Edit: why would I download the updated app if you don't offer what I need. Fix the app and I'll download it. Till then, see you Edit: you offer limited speeds for bicycles and walking. So it's not like it isn't being done. You can and are already doing it. Just add a moped option.",,,,,,,,
366,"I wish this was better, then I could delete Google. This doesn't show alternative routes. The search isn't great either, it often doesn't show places that come up straight away on the devil's Google Maps - I can often find roads, but when I type in a number on the road it doesn't show it. :(",,,,,,,,
367,Terrible. Keeps coming up with couldnt sink doesnt show me any of my blogs. cant go on setting cant post nothing the only thing that works is view my site. It worked the first day i downloaded the app then i did some work to my site put some posts on etc and after that the app just went terribly wrong. whoever runs this app seriously need to fix it coz its just a joke. if i want to blog when im out and dont have a laptop with me i cant coz this app dont work. Sort this App out now!!!,,,,,,,,
368,"Current Update many issues 1) Leaves GPS active upon exit, must force exit running background apps of Maps.me. 2) Since maps split, Favourites sluggish to completely unusable.  Was supurb prior to change. 3) Current permission set way over the top, not openly documented. Was a stellar app, going downhill exponentially.  Android 4.4.2 Samsung GSIII",,,,,,,,
369,"Useful, but needs work Hats off to the dev team ... this app is easy to use and does its job. A major problem, though, with the Ireland maps (at least), was that route lines overlaid the street and highway names. So, we could use this app only as an advisory to a physical map, where we could see actual street and highway names. Google Maps solves this problem by putting the route lines over the streets but under the street names. Overall, close but no cigar ... hoping for improvement in the future!",,,,,,,,
370,Overall the functionality seems good however there's no sharing section in the Android app like in iOS. I have to go to mobile web to update. That's kind of pointless. I don't want to write in to development inside the app! Forward this to them geez.... That's not what I'm talking about and it's not in the app! Not sharing.... Posting it Twitter LinkedIn with checkbox and default if title. Still not functioning. Add this,,,,,,,,
371,"Well, the app used to work well until a few days back. I can't view my published posts or my media anymore, it keeps saying unable to refresh, I can't even reply to a comment. Now, I'm just stuck cuz it has refused to publish any post anymore. Please fix this.",,,,,,,,
372,"Why is this app here? Is it deliberate to just have reading functions only? What happened to rich text formatting, picture uploads, feature image settings and easy post uploads? I doubt this app would be on the Apple iTunes store with this rubbish. Fix up please",,,,,,,,
373,Became worse It was excellent light app. Now it shows map quickly but does not respond to touches approximately 10 secs. Phone is hot after a few minutes of using. It shows hardware OpenGL requirement. My phone does not have opengl. But one year ago app worked perfectly without that.,,,,,,,,
374,"I AM SO SORRY I EVER INSTALLED IT. This app is malfunctioning in several ways, relating to strange displays of blog text. Once OVERLAPPING so the post displayed UNDER or OVER the photo of prior post. The next time, yesterday, so the text displayed WAY OUT TO THE RIGHT. Reader has to swipe far, far to the keft to view it. What a disaster for a writer trying to create a following of readers.",,,,,,,,
375,overall Wordpress is a great App except that it Needs a Block button to prevent or eliminate online bullies. now my only alternative is to block comments or delete my Blog. already I was forced to delete several Blog Posts because of haters and flamers. Also I can't change my credit card information on this App.,,,,,,,,
376,"Nice map interface! Works fine, but cumbersome to use, almost impossible to locate addresses and limited capabilities! eg. the search results did not reflect the known address or city typed in; two US States were downloaded and every address search for the secondary State only gave results in the primary (home) state; responded slowly to Rerouting, resulting to missing a critical turn; a favorite place was identified and stored, but seemed locked and wouldn't open, when selected.....",,,,,,,,
377,Love it but where's my schedule? Update: I still do not have web and app showing the same schedule.               I set up my schedule already online but when I log in to the app it doesn't show any of my selections.,,,,,,,,
378,"Offline issues Current location is the prime essential to search between two locations for routing. So without internet, it cant be ascertained and navigation is not possible at all i guess then and this contradicts the fact  told by you that this app is an offline navigation map. Please correct me if am wrong.",,,,,,,,
379,"This app use to be amazing. I used it for 2 years while traveling, but now it seems they just don't care. The app has become so slow to do anything. Sometimes taking over a minute to even load the search function. As soon as you resize the map everything disappears and you have to wait another minute for it to come back. All of this use to be instant. For an offline map the only thing they seem to be updating is online features like traffic and stuff. Its basically becoming useless. Instead of deleting it I have decided to post this review in hopes that they will fix it. This was once my go-to app for everything. Now I can't even use it",,,,,,,,
380,"I realy become upset when I have checked the map of my country. I am from Azerbaijan and our borders and our independence is recognized by UN and all other international organizations. but I don't know why 20% of our lands, The Qarabagh region is showed like a ""Nagorno Qarabagh"" and named it like a independance republic. May be you don't geography and low then let me explain to you. You CANNOT put countries which are not recognized by UN in your apps. I hope this 'mistake' will be corrected!!!",,,,,,,,
381,"The app has a great interface but it lacks some of the feature of its uglier yet more functional peers such as: routing without tolls, moyorways or ferries, indicating the specific lane to select on motorways, graphical selection of the maps to download (you have to know the name of the region!). Until these get added, Maps.me remains a last resort option.",,,,,,,,
382,"Used to be the best map. Great features, easy to use, but it has ONE MAJOR BUG that has been there for 2 years - they sometimes solve it, most of the time they mess it up.  It is a very simple thing : the option to save maps to SD CARD.  Sometimes an update would relocate your maps to the phone, sometimes it would delete all maps, sometimes you had to uninstall and reinstall, sometimes ....  This time they have surpassed it : it moved all my SD CARD maps to memory, filling it right up!! And today there is no option to locate maps to SD CARD any more.  2 years and they still can't get this simple but ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL feature to hold.  So, finally, I'm done and, guess what, in doing so, after trying 8 apps I have found an even better one :  HERE MAPS.",,,,,,,,
383,"didnt help one bit, unfortunately. currently in HK and failed several times locating or navigating to simple destinations about 6-20 min away. Arrow location is buggy and jumps from street to street. I like the idea but walking around using this app gets you nowhere. Citymapper is way more accurate. i hope this app improves as i like the idea of offline maps",,,,,,,,
384,"Intrusive popups This app asks to enable GPS like every five seconds even for the operations unrelated to the current location. Then eventually a modal dialog asking for a play store review will pop up. There is no option to permanently disable further requests of that kind, just to ask later. This app used to be the best offline map, now it is below usable.",,,,,,,,
385,"I would love tolove this app, something to get away from Google, but as much as I try I just cannot work it out. I've downloaded offline maps that I can't work out how to find to open, I've tried planning routes from my current location to a nominated destination, no deal, I can't work out how to do that either.",,,,,,,,
386,Needs Search option Bookmark set needs search option followed by organize in the marker list. Cannot search bookmarks placed on the map.,,,,,,,,
387,"After installing the app it showed my location and the street name was completely wrong. I wanted to see what routes it would offer me to my father's village, but a search by the name of the village did not yield any results. Uninstalled.",,,,,,,,
388,Uploading media does not work properly. Some files do not upload and the app does not resume automatically which is annoying. But even worse: Some files are uploaded several times if you try to re-upload and then you end up with duplicates. Also if the app closes in the background it starts uploading all media of a post again. There is also no source editing. Recently it just started crashing in the media library. In summary the media upload is useless.,,,,,,,,
389,Good Software before the last update... Since the latest update you are showing me shops and restaurants that are 10000 miles away from my current location! So...thank you for the update... Update: My current location was determined by GPS but I had to look on the map for shops and hotels because the search function showed me things on other continents.,,,,,,,,
390,"Navigation got better, but still will not use it as a main navigation app for car. Please fix: if there are a lot of points in a bookmark set, the list isn't scrolling or scrolling very very slowly",,,,,,,,
391,Edited my rating from 5 stars to 1 star. I supported the devs by purchasing the app when it first launched. Very disappointed that they have now inserted ads in search results in the latest update. I have reverted to version 8.4.9 and will NOT be updating this app anymore.,,,,,,,,
392,"Photo uploads disappears in a post When I type something on a post then attaches a photo, then continues typing on the same post, that photo sometimes mysteriously disappears. It gets kinda frustrating when my post needs several photos and they keep disappearing as I type. Please fix!  And the new user interface looks like it's opened from a browser. I think the previous UI looks neater n gives greater convenience. I feel that the layout now defeats the purpose of a mobile app.",,,,,,,,
393,Decent but not very functional! I find myself having to do everything from my PC rather than here. The app has no function to edit blog settings like Dashboard and posting on this app leaves a lot to be desired. It has little to no support for drafting and I cannot insert images and properly edit their positions within the text. Overall the app needs some major updates.,,,,,,,,
394,"Too many problems, posts empty posts, deletes local drafts = garbage app Deletes locally saved posts, posts empty posts, takes forever to upload a few lines of text and a dozen photos. I will not be using WordPress ever again because of this garbage app. Worked for a while and then endless problems. Should be able to access forum from app. Use an alternative site like blogger or something. I have lost a lot of hard work and my patience is at an end. I would give it 0 if I could.",,,,,,,,
395,"Very poor. The most ridiculous and non-functional app I've ever seen. There are so many bags I cannot even name! I cannot upload any photo, the scale of new post creation page is over sized that I can't see all the options. The navigation is enormously vague. I don't see comments I've made and blogs I follow. Finally the app crashes all the time. Well... The raw job. It's irritating.",,,,,,,,
396,"Doesn't work well with plugins Sends a publish event which posts to Twitter even though it's an update to a post and not a new one. Web interface works fine, and so did the last version of the app.",,,,,,,,
