135175,"Yet to be seen so far awesome I haven't used it much. The only thing that I miss is the speaker. I can't use my voice to type. It's so much quicker to be able to talk to your phone. When doing searches. That's all you need to do is figure out a way to add this it is a must for me to continue on DuckDuckGo. Otherwise it would be a five-star review*****."
135177,"An excellent option for privacy minded users who want a no nonsense, no frills experience (like Firefox users who don't like the Daylight upgrade). Those desiring a more complete and well rounded experience should look for either Vivaldi, Brave, or the aformentioned Firefox (my personal favorite), but those who find those experiences overwhelming or unsatisfying for whatever reason should be happy with this, especially if they like the browser extension for desktop."
135183,"NOT PRIVATE, ALLOWS PHOTOS OF PAGES, AND DIALOG BOXES FREEZE PAGES! If you can ask me if a page should have access to my location YOU ARE NOT PRIVATE! Unscrollable dialog boxes to reject request, by font size is unacceptable. These are simple and standard code! You can't do this right? ALLOWS PRIVATE PAGES TO BE SCREENSHOT! You can, I won't!"
135186,"9/8 All of the sudden your browser is allowing a webpage I visit, daily, to show a preview of five of their headlines in a popup window. Stop that. 9/10 My tabs are still closing randomly. Stop that as well. 9/12 Seriously, you have to stop closing my tabs. I will close them when I chose to close them."
135188,"Latest version search from the address bar gives a blank page. Workaround is to touch the A icon top left the back arrow. Great private browser but really needs forced page zoom option."
135213,"Not Private At All!!! I've searched something and saved to my bookmarks. When I go back 2 search something else the moment I type first letter IT SHOWS UP RECENTLY ADDED BOOKMARKS UNDER THE SEARCH TAB exposing it 2 everyone. How private it is? I want to search something but don't want people that are looking at my phone to see my last added bookmarks or any other sorts of suggestions, history? I thought this search engine is to keep your privacy hidden... I was wrong."
135234,"Good security features but very poor bookmark process (save, edit and delete but no folder options)."
135236,"I love the app, but I'm tired of having to constantly re-download it because after a certain amount of searches (not many at all) all the rest will just show up as "Webpage not available" and it will have a bunch of other stuff, and the only way to fix this that I've found is un-installing it and installing it back. I've pretty much just stopped using it because of this, it is VERY annoying. I like the service, but not the glitch."
135238,"App (and webpage) used to be great. Recently though, the search results have gotten awful. When I'm shopping, I like to shop. When I'm looking for adjustment or repair procedures for something I've already bought, that is what I want to see. The search results used to reflect this. Now, almost all of the results are, "buy, buy, buy". When I'm looking for the procedure to program the key fob for my car, I don't want to see result after result trying to sell me a new car."
135240,"Needs some work but better than Google ,needs to have voice recognition for searches."
135254,"Has issues signing into websites using Google, Facebook, etc. It also has issues downloading and opening PDFs. When I attempt to log in using Google, it just switches to a different tab and then the website states there was a problem logging me in. When I try it on Chrome, I have no problems. The same happens when downliading a file. The browser also can't handle several websites. It'll crash or not connect to the site."
135270,"Trash. It looks good and all but it's very terrible to use. It has glitches sometimes you can't scroll up it just reloads the page when you try to. Desktop version of sites never works. There are known issues with the searches from desktop version anyway same thing here, many images, links, local sites not having priority in search. Wrong meaning of privacy, it can't do what you want cause that would do what duckduckgo does: limit the browser, searches. Going back to stock browsers. :)"
135271,"Really tested this app to see its capabilities. Good so far with some complaints. It doesn't block pop ups very well. Pop ups get through as another tab opened in the background. I haven't found a setting for that yet. Also, backing out doesn't bring you to the original search page, which sucks. Playing videos within the app won't allow for auto landscape/portrait adjustment. Overall, the app is ok, but I would really like to see more improvements."
135275,"I like this browser for the most part, but recently it has been freezing frequently, hence only two stars. I use it in combination with PIA VPN. [I mention this only because it might be relevant to the browser freezes.] Also, is there a way to disable drag-down refresh? It's really annoying to try to scroll down while typing into a text field, only to refresh instead and have to restart the entire text entry. (TIA)"
135276,"Honestly, I was loving DuckDuckGo. I used it for all my web searches. But ever since the recent update, I haven't been able to search anything. It keeps showing"error : name not resolved" and doesn't give any results even with a perfectly fine network connection. I'm sorry, but I can't give a 5 star rating unless the app does what it's supposed to. Devs, fix this."
135283,"I like it, the privacy and info it provides... but on my phone it's hard to use. It opens so many pages in a new window, I have a hard time finding where I am. Sometimes I look up and I'll have 15-20 separate windows open and I have to close them all. Also, wish I could turn on the ability to use my microphone for speech to text. I realize the privacy issues but sometimes I need to get a long message in and can't sit there and any type it all in on my phone. Too much work, back to Chrome."
135290,"Devs, please fix this, when I type in a search bar on YouTube, or any other site that has a search bar, my key typing app works once, but then after the second time, when I click the search bar, my typing app does not show and it's only when I use duck duck go. Google never has this problem as my keyboard on my phone always works, it stops working when using ur browser, please fix that urgently. I always have to close ur browser and then re open it for my typing app to work, SwiftKey app."
135296,"I really like this browser. However it has a lot of options and features that I don't understand. I am learning as I go, but I've already lost tabs I wanted to keep by having chosen the wrong setting. My fault but still annoying. I do really LOVE the fact that it shows me the trackers it has blocked and that it can make whatever sight I'm on safer. Will upgrade stars when and if I figure out how to use this browser effectively. Overall a really nice, fast browser."
135297,"Hello, I have been using DuckDuckGo for quite a longer time. It has been a nice experience while surfing through internet with privacy been protected as well. There are few things that make this browser outdated: 1. The image files are downloaded in '.bin' format while almost all phone galleries support '.jpeg' or '.jpg' format. This thing is terribly wrong and spoils the taste of internet surfing. 2. Unlike Google Chrome there is no option of downloading the page for offline view."
135311,"Only just installed. Seems fast enough. Irritating messages telling you how good the app is. Being different it will take some time to get used to, if I last that long through those messages. Uninstalled due to irritating messages. Search results seemed to be a bit on the light side, but maybe I am used to receiving irrelevant sesrch results (more but irrelevant)."
135317,"Privacy is awesome but this browser has some trade offs that make it not as enjoyable. It's missing the mark on UX. Down swipe from the top on the page to reload like Chrome is a staple in the browser experience. This could be 10x better if the reload button was a quick button like the tabs or flame button. Swipe to switch tabs (Chrome) should be considered as well. I guess I'll stick to Chrome and a VPN for now."
135328,"Whoever wrote the recent changes screwed up the program! Crashes repeatedly and even causes my tablet to reboot. What a shame, it was my favorite before but now its almost too annoying to use. My latest issue is the program locking up on startup - black screen with no way out. Uninstalled and reinstalled, now my bookmarks are gone."
135330,"This app was amazing at some point because it was smooth and true to it's word about privacy but about a month ago it started making my screen flicker and glitch. It only seems to happen with this app and I have few other apps that I use in a daily but this one has honestly began to disappoint me. I deleted it and reinstalled it to see if it would fix but it remains with it's flickering, I would improve my review if the issue can be fixed, I really did love this app at some point."
135332,"It doesn't work sometimes, randomly. Search for some page, progress bar is moving, nothing happens. Check the same page in chrome - all is ok. Go back to duckduck page not opening. So this something with duck search. It hangs for no reason. You have to fix that."
135337,"constant slow loading speed, empty search results, links not working and limited settings ruin this app. I thought this ran on bing's search engine, but compared results tell a different story. The results I do get, I'm only able to actually click on 1/4 of them without toggling the privacy protection to load them. Now it's making me leave the app and come back in. It's very annoying doing that on repeat for clicks that are incredibly delayed and turn the page white from not loading. Broken...."
135343,"Good, but could be better, some things don't load on certain sites, there not dodgy sites either. Some sites won't load at all, I.e my girlfriends NHS site for blu light card won't work on duck duck go so she has to use google. When I click on the search bar on some sites my keyboard won't pop up to type, I have to exit, and reopen duck duck go, this never happens on Google, but I don't want to use the corrupt google so I'll pit up with these little niggles. 5 stars if you can sort these out."
135345,"Very good browser with some common features missing. Namely... * pull down to refresh the page * Options to put bookmarks or favourites or frequently visited or recently visited or SOMETHING on the new tab homescreen. EDIT: Also, no 'share to printer' feature, and a list of 'valid domains' pops up randomly in a window, covering the keyboard. Furthermore, 'back' from a tab with no history just goes to a blank page, rather than closing the tab and returning to the previous one."
135348,"Sadly I had to uninstall this app. I attempted to use it with doxy and it blocked my camera and microphone. Doxy instructed me to change my browser settings however when I attempted to do so duck made no Provisions for me to do so. Firefox is in the dumper. It seems like the choices for a reliable browser or diminishing daily"
135356,"Not so great search results and the videos will not play on any website I go to such as Daystar television or even Amazon videos advertising a product. I really like the idea of not having my every move tracked but i very much enjoy Daystar and may have to go back to Google or safari or firefox to watch it. I will add that certain websites have functioned with increased speed which is definitely a plus."
135358,"It's a wonderful app in general however there are times when it wont load and I have to go back to using chrome. It would also be lovely if there was a feature on here where I can use the microphone on my keypad to do talk to text. Thanks"
135361,"Sorry new update doesn't allow me to go through duckduckgo search directly, instead I have to type each website completely then it opens up. I believe it's a bug. And also the theme previously had a different choices to have a look but now we don't get it please allow us to enable different theme setup in the list of personalizing the app as it was in the previous version of the app. There is still lot of bugs in this version"
135367,"Love the DDG team, and have been an ardent supporter since day one oh so many years ago. But there is no plugin framework, so uMatrix and uBlock functionality are not available. If you are used to a beautiful internet free of ads and malicious redirects, this browser cannot yet deliver until they add script management. If you love ads and getting irreversibly punted out of sites with dodgy scripts, and just want a modest privacy improvement, DDG browser is for you. Hope they improve it!!"
135369,"Having an issue downloading pictures or files recently. Downloads unsuccessful all the time now. Didn't have this issue when I first installed this app. Otherwise a great app. Update: downloading issue corrected, but now downloaded files can't be moved to another folder or posted to social media."
135370,"So far so good 3 stars because it ask for a rating a bit too early in my time of exp. However i wd certainly like to take the time to thank the developers for recognizing a need, then building a product around that need, then adapt and overcome the many hurdles of red tape that exists in the worlds microsoft, android, and mac, who all lately seem so hell bent on in your face repeated onslaught advertising, no longer trying to weed out the scammers, just sell sell sell. Will edit to 5 stars later"
135372,"Good browser..but some areas where it lags tonuc browser: 1. It doesn't provides zoom in feature in a page wherein the font size and the matter adjusts to page width only, one doesn't have to swipe right and left to read time and again. 2.basic feature such as history bar, so one can search any older webpage. 3.no download section to refer downloaded files directly. So developers, not just speed matters, in this competitive world , you have to be on ur toes"
135377,"I love that it keeps trackers at Bay, and maybe I'm missing it but. When I do a search I have to open a new search window sometimes I can't just hit 'home' or 'back' to go back to he search page, ,it's a little frustrating. But so far so good."
135395,"Changing my rating down to one star after recent updates. Pages sometimes dont load at all, links do not work when tapped on sometimes. Now having to tap on links multiple times for them to open. This needs to be checked. I'm on a fully updated Sony Xperia XZ1 Compact running Android 9."
135397,"Good search engine but the dark mode doesn't apply automatically to the search part of the app. Always having to set the search page to dark theme manually is extremely tedious especially when you've already selected dark mode in the app itself. If this wasn't so frustrating I'd probably give it 5 stars."
135404,"I like what the browser is trying to do as far as personal security goes. However without text wrap where you can zoom in on the page and have the text reflow to fit it is pretty much useless who can read text says microscopically small. And who wants to stretch the text only to have to scroll side to side to read it hopefully they will address this soon if not it's pretty much useless to me"
135409,"Really love this browser, but one thing need to be update, make video download easy way like UC browser. When I paste a link for video in UC browser it will ask for download option with in a second. In Duck Duck Go never asks that, it directly playing the video, it is take too time to play or download. So this is my suggestion. After it will be my perfect browser. Thankyou"
135413,"Sometimes it blocks important documents that I need, i guess it thinks that they are spam and they actually are not...i have a choice rather to accept duckduckgo or not...not the choice to accept duckduckgo but also accept my documents as well...i hope im clear...is there a way to accept duckduckgo and also accept certain documents....i really do like the app though"
135423,"The search results seem to be fewer than those provided by Google, and yet they match the search string less precisely. The browser also seems to be much slower to load pages, particularly noticeable with pages containing video."
135425,"I really like what you guys do but to be concurrence to google you really have to improve your search engine. Get inspiration from google mechanisms. Embedded direct defintions would be really nice. Also I'd appreciate the small question section (with answers) google has. There generally need to be more features that give information about the query before clicking on any link. People want to use their search engine as fast as possible. The browser-app in general is nicely done and practical."
135427,"search results are often completely wrong/bizarre so of little use to me. Ive now been told that google now own this browser,some under counter deal done. Explains why it doesnt stop google tracking you,and why its started to get "clunky",often pausing for no reason.. Not whats it was originally intended to be thats for sure.. :( Ive also no idea why it keeps activating the camera but its well suspect imo.none of my other browsers does that. Sticky tape over cam lens haha.fkem."
135430,"I used to love it but now it's very annoying trying to scroll and instead refreshes it (losing sometimes text already typed). Once in a while freezes after a few attempts to access the tabs (and instead refreshing) and I can't scroll nor access tabs, it's very frustrating. Please allow users to disable it."
135435,"Love what you are doing security. 10 Search is not as good as babble I hope you know what I mean. In saying that I believe that they are attacking your search software and they keep trying to track my searches don't know why. I'm not that important."
135436,"Everything is good or I can say great in this app except there's no downloading page icon available and I am the person who download movies and songs etc everyday. So I am supposing that soon this feature will be available in this app like uc and opera browser then this app is going to be the best available until then I will keep it uninstalled."
135438,"Used to be very happy with 🦆 🦆 go. Some sites are browser broken so still have to use Chrome still in incognito but not many. Just this week mobile web Gmail has gone weird and duckduckgo forces a preview pane on a phone screen when there's no room for it! Chrome displays it correctly but duckduckgo has a 1/3 of the screen mashed up with an email preview."
135442,"Great browser that ended up breaking. Scrolling through facebook, twitter, and youtube causes the browser to flash black and white when a video begins playing. Scrolling through facebook or washington post causes browservto flash making the browser pretty useless. Gave it 3 stars though as im sure this is a temprorary bug and the browser worked fine before. For now, ill be switching overbto Firefox, hopefully duck devs fix the flashing issue soon before i end up staying with firefox."
135447,"New version not at all good. With latest update some websites like gmail opens in segment view. I. E. The highlighted mail opens in side. And we can't access it any way. We have to load in dektop version of site then only the mail can be viewed. This is after last update yesterday. Before that it was working fine. No other change."
135460,"I have been using Duck for many months now and it has been great but for the last couple of days the sites aren't loading, to be precise no sites are loading, it is not even letitng me search anything. I have got used to this app now and it would be helpful if you look into the matter Thanks"
135462,"It's a great app should you wish to browse without the hassles of ads. Only drwabackdrawback is that you can't go back to the previous tab. Either than that, it's proper"
135466,"Clean UI, and fast. Main complaint is results are sometimes completely off base. I will search something on web results, and then click on images and the results barely match up. (Safe search is off) Tested against chrome and Bing and they provide accurate results. Thought ddg used their results but it could be how they parse the data"
135467,"Twitter website seems to not work well on this app, videos never play at all"
135475,"So far I like it. Seems clutter free. However an Exit choice in the menu would be nice. Update: has frozen a couple of times to the point I had to go into settings and do a force stop. Even swiping it to the right didn't close it."
135479,"I enjoy the feature of closing the tabs and clearing the history. I'd like this app better if it would clear cookies out at more frequent interval. I like thr new feature of letting me know when it blocked trackers. Some way to have bookmarks/ favorites would better very nice also."
135482,"The latest update ruined it. Websites keep getting stuck or load only partially. Clicking the 🔥 button does nothing and hangs the browser into a blank screen. I have to use the Android app switcher key or long press the home button to come out. Only restarting the phone fixes this after it happens. Please fix it."
135489,"Data security is a very big lie ! My browsing history and location history being used by Facebook even after browsing only through this browser. Keyboard wont appear automatically for some websites unless we refresh the page. Videos in webpage feed goes blank for few seconds...i dont know why ! Hope bugs would be fixed in nxt update."
135493,"Do not use this app or duckduckgo if you value your privacy. It sends data back to their US based servers and tracks your web history (you can check the discussions on the app's GitHub). The fact the app doesn't even give you the same amount of options to check what it's doing with your data is also alarming. This is not a privacy app."
135495,"After the recent update, whenever I search anything it always shows "Error: webpage not available". My internet connection is totally fine and chrome works perfectly well but I don't know what's wrong with duckduckgo. If this issue gets resolved, I am ready to rate it 5 stars."
135497,"Since I've been using DuckDuckGo, I have had more security breaches -- including exposure and subsequent spamming of my last private email address that I use to conduct business, received emails containing content involving a medical procedure I recently had (and I have ALWAYS kept my microphone disabled in ALL apps except my calling app), an attempted Twitter hack (I haven't logged in to Twitter in 5 years), and a stolen debit card number -- than I have ever had in my history of using the web."
135501,"It has gotten worse. The browser is following all other browsers. The settings you put in place are not saving, ads appear on every search as the first few links, and there is no help to fix the issues."
135502,"I was pleased with this browser at first, but for some reason, when I watch a youtube video or webm, it will start flashing colours and not move a single frame. Please fix this, or I might have to switch to a different one"
135503,"Well duck duck go doesn't offer what it promises. I have set it's setting to clear data on closing the app but when I reopen the app everything is there as I left it. And one more thing after I logout my any Id(fb, Twitter etcetera etcetera) though after reopening the app I see my account running like I never logged out. So there you have it."
135524,"Hate this appp. Most of the sites are broken in this browser. Also Desktop view is not working correctly. I log in a site with this app and the site is broken in this browser I tried to logout **** this app make me mad I can't logout also can't access through other browsers because I already logged in with this bloody app. Now I am mad this bloody app"
135538,"Apparently uses Chrome in the background, so not really private, and it lets censorship happen in websites, so again not private. UPDATE: And now it is completely bought into the Google and Facebook censorship with certain particular videos "glitching" and unwatchable while others, all particular ones, are fine."
135542,"The new update is garbage! Keep the old version as long as you can! There are certain searches/sites that now get an error message when you try to load them now... I know it isn't me, because my other browser has no problem accessing these...."
135548,"It's good to use. But I miss video forwarding and reversing feature using guestures. Like we should be able to forward the video by swiping the finger towards right and similarly swiping left should reverse it."
135552,"Edit: The app is completely nonfunctional when I'm using NordVPN...which is frustrating considering this browser is marketed to people who value security and privacy. My only complaint is that the spacebar on the keyboard is too small, and I constantly end up typing periods on accident."
135556,"Allow this app to be moved to SD card for android 7 nougat users. I would like Norton to protect this browser. I dont feel very comfortable searching as no indication if sites are safe to go to. Otherwise appreciate your privacy motivated app."
135560,"I love this browser. But the pull to refresh update, just ruined my experience. Even a slight pull would simply initiate the refresh, although I don't want it. Let me just pull!, then it can refresh!!!!"
135569,"Security and anti tracking features are what caught my eye but after using it for a while I noticed that region specific searches aren't very good! I live in Ireland and most results are from UK so it's not quite where I need it to be for usability."
135579,"It's ok but not great. Loading times can be slow or timeout. Also lately it keeps giving me the message that your offline atm but I know that's not the case. Like I said it acts weird....a lot!!!"
135582,"Was very happy with it for the first two days then somehow, my SD card got corrupted & I lost a lot of stuff! A lot. So as you can imagine I was less than happy. For the life of me I cannot figure out what went wrong. The only thing different that I had done was try this browser for a couple of days."
135585,"After filling out a long series of questions, I hit a website page error and had to go back. DDG did not just go back one link. It went back to its own home page losing all the progress I had already made, totally inacceptable. Uninstalling DDG permanently."
135589,"Will edit the ratings if I get a valid response I am unable to search for anything, can't visit sites, it'll just time out the connection. But if I turn on my VPN it'll fix it. I'm from India and I'm pretty sure this app isn't banned, any solution to this?"
135606,"This browser has been great until maybe the last update. Now, whenever I execute a search, it fails to load the search results and gives me a blank white screen until I use the button to sort of reload."
135611,"Love the unbiased and readily available information with no algorithms to shove propaganda in your face. But UI needs a little work. Just needs to be a little more user friendly. The little things you know?"
135617,"When I first saw the availability of a DuckDuckGo browser it seemed like a good thing. After all I prefer their search engine to google. But this thing has an annoying popup feature the only purpose for which seems to be to annoy me. Guess what - it works! I am annoyed. Uninstalling this pos. "You got this""
135627,"I love the app but lately I can barely get any page to load without refreshing it multiple times. Without the glitch it's a 5 star app, but the glitch is very frustrating."
135635,"VERY UNHAPPY,i just updated the app and once it was done ALL my "add to home screen"short cuts are GONE!I had schooling sites saved too and now its all gone!this is not ok I will be deleting, what is the point of privacy if i can't revisit sites that are saved to my phone."
135641,"Hi - two stars. No option to import or export bookmarks. No option to install add ons. The only good thing is the browser can be configured."
135654,"Downloading is a mess, files don't download correctly and no progress bar is showing, requiring you to hit the download link twice to confirm it was actually downloaded. Some files are literally 1% downloaded with no status update. It's killing my interest"
135665,"compare to chrome.. search results are more competitive in chrome... in privacy it's better than chrome... also less ads in the browser.. but it did a worst job in downloading.. it messed with song's name..."
135667,"Was good till latest update, you are on a website for a bit and as you scroll down deeper it suddenly fails with an error code and apology, back out and go back in and same thing happens again. Back to Chrome until this is resolved."
135668,"a few issues... #1 so if i use duck duck go browser, i cant really look up things near me accurately which sucks because then i jave to use chrome which makes it pointless. #2 sometimes the service is jist soooooo slow. i know it uses other engines but still... if its a browser it needs to step up."
135673,"Suffers from over zealous support for pull down refresh to the point where I've had to stop using it. EVERY time I pull down to look up the page, the thing reloads. How this got through testing I don't know."
135677,"Nice user experience, but with a few caveats: it appears to take ages to startup, and then seems to reload each tab after switching."
135685,"So, this app is a overall good, private browser that protects you. My problem, is that you can just download something like Cake ™ or Yandex™ and be protected while it's still going fast. That's it."
135687,"While I applaud DuckDuckGo's commitment to privacy, there many painfully stupid implementations of core features, and the actual search capability is not that great, so it winds up requiring a lot more work than Google. Be prepared for repeated hair tearing and face palms."
135710,"The App is great appart from when the screen decides to go black, twitchy and flashy. Its very annoying and cant see anything on the web page until i reload it. But the it does it again in 30 seconds."
135715,"All searches match google. Its google owned and their stealing your data. Fellow conservatives stay faraway from this app and their search engine. Yahoo and bing give better results unlike this trash. Also app never opens websites correctly and downloads all attachments as .bin COMPLETE TRASH."
135725,"Great Web Browser, but recent update spoilt it! 😔 Do not like the square tabs, can't read titles / Web address properly. Please change back to the full width of screen or at least let us chose..... Shame because was just about perfect be."
135750,"It is quite fast, but it totally hides & blocks interactive text boxes on websites(forms). It is impossible to read talkbacks on legit news websited. It does that even on sites pre-defined as unproteded."
135767,"Might be the worst browser I've ever used. Seems tailor made to make you watch as many ads as possible, with no way to stop or even slow them down. An absolute nightmare. Strongly do not recommend!"
135768,"Decent browser but no option to turn off cookies"
135770,"1.Guys you have to work on add blocker you have to make it more powerfull.. And i think you can make it... And the second one is whenever i am visiting on a website like movies site it's opening a new add tab and when i press the back button i jumped on the homepage... Please fix it as soon as possible...."
135776,"Can't search anything in this browser. Everytime I search for something it says web page not available 😒.Also My internet is working very fine.I even tried to reinstall it. It's just this browser that's not working."
135814,"Losing lots of tabs and then not finding the contents again. No history. Not great tbh. Works fine to browse until you want it to be a browser some manner beyond viewing."

135849,"Sorry, want to give it five stars. But I can't use my microphone and I refuse to enter text by hand. I use Duck DuckGo with Firefox and it works great. But this app is a no-go."
135882,"No navigation buttons. Too many websites simply refresh the page when clicking the return, leaving you permanently on a site with zero option to back out. This browser only has one direction, forward."

136025,"only one thing I dont like, cannot put in a home page, alwayws have to write search engine tags on browser box, like to see webpage instead of empty page saying duck duck duck duck duck duck freaking GO! Tired of it. Who's the genius that invented the name?"

136158,"Such a waste of time, my Samsung tablet frozed up when I tried to open it, worst case scenario is that it didn't do one bit to block any ads at all."
136174,"Normally great. Since the latest update I've been having lots of issues where pages will freeze."
136175,"It's ok. Blocks tracking cookies, but not Ads or scripts and no option for add-ons that do."

136309,"It was pretty good for the first few weeks but it freezes A LOT which is extremely annoying."

137702,"It's good but you can improve it. 1. the back button must close de new tab and go to previous page. 2. The tool and address bar must be put at the bottom of the page to reach with one hand. 3. Give more buttons on the toolbar (where is the forward - you don't have to push another button to find it). 4. give me more privacy options. 5. give me an ad blocker. 6.

137760,"Was great for a couple of days until it stopped working"
137766,"Would prefer a home screen with a search field other than the address bar. I guess I'm a bit old school. I would prefer to keep the address bar visible at all times, but I can't find any option to allow that. Also, backing out of tabs doesn't work to go back to a previous screen. Instead, when backing out of a link opened in a new tab, I get the home screen on the new tab rather than the tab I left so I must individually close tabs."
137775,"Good app but it's slow even with fast internet"
137808,"Good app tells you more about visiting pages in real time"
137817,"Every Time you scroll in any page the screen becomes black"
137818,"not accurate search engine and failed to request desktop mode"
137850,"Did love this app. But have since tested app with Panopticlick (which I trust - check it out) and find that protection against trackers is only partial. I am testing other browser apps and find others such as Brave and Firefox give full protection. Please explain. I will never trust 'claims again and will always test and suggest others do too. Now I will use duck duck go search engine only with Brave or Firefox = no trackers. All trackers must go, no exceptions."
137851,"I have not yet been able to apply this app to my needs. Now in theory I love the idea. So, if there could be a step by step instuction manual that could help me out, that would be good.6/19/2020 I love this app! I feel as if someone is looking out for me, not Biggie's Google. Facebook Cloud.... Etc, etc. I have told my friends about it, they'll be joining soon. Thank You, Cheryl Cady"
137852,"Dark theme isn't dark, only the app UI gets black but not the webpage"
137854,"VERY BAD APPLICATION ITS NOT WORKING PROPERLY NEED MORE IMPROVEMENT TOO SLOW FOR BROWSING..."
137859,"I search any thing he take many much time compair to another application and he take average 2 min to open any site"
137863,"There are certain pages/YT videos that seem to infere with this browser and wouldn't allow me to view them. There are times that this browser doesn't directly answer my queries, and sometimes give me irrelevant results. I seem to be able to search anything thru its search engine, but after using this for a while, there was a certain website that is blocked in this browser and would not let me view it."
137875,"Privacy is nice - but options are too limited"
137879,"This app is no longer a reliable browser for censor-free searches."
137897,"App is more time freeze when i am open any website"
137901,"Search is useless outside english language pages."
137911,"Was surprisingly good at first besides a few missing features from chrome for Android. Ultimately what made me uninstall is that webpages just wouldn't load approximately 50% of the time. I wound up manually copying URLs into chrome or edge to get it to load instead. In the comparison to chrome, I missed the swipe down to bring up all tabs and swipe left or right to delete."
137927,"Doesnt open gmail properly. Cant read it."
137928,"I like the privacy this browser offers, but one feature of this app is mildly annoying to infuriating. Hitting the 'back' button on my phone allows me to go a page back, but going past the original page typed in exits the app and I need to renavigate to the site all over again. I was just now filling out a form with many fields and lost all data because the app exited from hitting back one too many times. Chrome and Ghostery never did this and it's incredibly annoying."
137936,"Like having this option for a private search engine. NOT happy that Google is dominating our LIVES. Have found that going to another "search" requires I delete the page I'm on to start the search. Takes time to learn a new system and obviously Google has been our school for browsing. Will try hard to stick with this service!"
137952,"Used to be good. Now there is some cutesy popup in the browser that you can't turn off. I want to block popups, not have you put your own instead. Update: The popups seem to have finally stopped. Seems a bit sluggish on java heavy sites and occasionally crashes but otherwise works well enough."
137956,"Very poor browser, can't do much with it"
137961,"just about good enough to use but has some usability issues.______ pro: good for privacy. as fast as others.______ cons: no forced zoom option for pages. it's sometimes difficult to scroll down a page without 'accidentally' clicking something. when scrolling down you often get a warp speed movement. if a link opens in a new tab then you click back it doesn't close that window and return you to the original tab. you can't highlight text in Facebook to copy"
137976,"I like how much private it is, but I don't like that is not saving my websites that I visited regularly - well I can add them to the bookmark list but is not very handy, also I need to log in to certain websites everytime I close the app even if I select an option such as "remember me". Overall, better than chrome."
137978,"I have tried for three months now, to get rid of the Gestyy-virus that your browser is allowing onto my phone. Your ad-blocker simply does not work and I find it a gross misrepresentation of what you are claiming your browser is capable of. But it is a lie. I am therefore uninstalling and disabling your browser."

137989,"It has one major problem It won't wait patiently on you Like a little child it wants to be helpful. At the wrong times but it's a winner the keeper and extremely useful and serves a good purpose even when its creeping.around an you Really need to uninstall it for a minute) cuz I'd rather have it then be without my 🤗 seven-year-old creep 😝😋🥰 he really does mean well🤗. (This coming from me Is saying a lot I hate to share ! TerryC"
138023,"Eats up far too much RAM for a no-frills mobile browser and likely has memory leaks as no browser app should be using nearly 50 memory (1.7+ GB) max use with just one tab open, leading to website navigation breaks and could lead to privacy/security issues. Not multitasking friendly. Needs a lot of work still but each update over several months doesn't improve it."
138032,"A faster way to get to bookmarks would be MUCH appreciated"
138035,"Works for a couple of times but it'll stop working for no reason"
138037,"The new update makes it freeze more frequently"
138038,"Not working. Not a single page upload."
138044,"Agonisingly slow and frequently crashes"
138062,"Doesn't work only shows webpage not available"
138077,"A great browser, however one flaw. Whilst the browser supports a dark theme, this does not work on actual websites, unlike many other browsers. So whilst you have a nice dark themed browser, you'll still be seeing websites with their blinding and battery draining white/light themes. Fix this issue and the rating will be higher!"
138081,"The browser will not load anything that I search up, DuckDuckGo more like DuckDuckNO!"
138083,"This app is very good and best but 1 problem if i download something i don't stop or pause this downloading. So please solve this problem or bug in your system hurry. .......by the way i am from india. And 1 more problem if i download something from your browser so those file is not moved in my memory"
138088,"Voice activate would be nice in search ability"
138098,"Like the app, but it needs maps, etc. If I'm giving up the notoriously leftist Google, I don't want to press "directions" on Duck and it automatically go to Google Maps. Needs work guys! Let's be TOTALLY independent of Google! I know you'll get there in time. I'm already telling friends to "Duck it!""
138101,"Great because I'm not getting any new ads on Facebook and other social media platforms.. Not great because it isn't the easiest browser to navigate.. That said I would recommend it to others looking for a browser that will help them eliminate unwanted ads"
138109,"Just getting to grips with internet security but this Brower has been very helpful so far."
138129,"I just started to use this browser, so I will update this review later, I left it at 3 stars for neutral for now"
138151,"i feel that few things which are supported in chrome are not supported in this browser"
138158,"It doesn't give immediate or direct web page surfing like google the search engines seems like google pulls more direct content related to your search where as duck go is still limited....it might just be me.but for the comfort of not being tracked I'll take it! Thanks HOWARD!!!!!LOL"
138170,"Good app but not good like uc browser no return page option"
138177,"Sorry but when i downloading image in duck duck go it cant it dont want let download the image and when i go to google ehen i download the image its not showing in my gallery and it says image bin and when i click it it just no search app or installed.this is very dissapointing"
138179,"I have tried to go further into something and couldnt and i have trued to look up things onky to get suggestions thst werent even close. Thank you."
138180,"As much as i like duckduckgo it worries me that google was historically against them and now google will update them, just doesnt feel right.."
138196,"Getting arabic in search box instead of English while typing."
138206,"My biggest problem is the lack of a back button on the browser this would be a great assistance in moving through a website. Otherwise I find the browser good and the fewer people with my browsing info the better."
138207,"Overall satisfactory but a couple problems. My biggest problem is search results usually don't have visible issue dates for the link information. Annoying when you're looking for current information. Even including dates in the search bar brings up old information."
138220,"I feel more confident with my privacy, great search engine! I've only been using DDG for my primary browser for less than a week, and at this point, the only thing I miss that other browsers have is the ability to enlarge what I'm viewing with my 2 fingers."
138237,"Very slow at opening web pages."
138249,"the mobile phone version ensures privacy. Laptop/PC Version of Chrome extension does not do so and shows all links. I have installed in another phone but all suggestions /complaints of missing Search box and widget have got no response."
138253,"Love the idea. Deviating from the concept of tabs is horribly obnoxious. Be private. Don't re-invent anything. Netscape is dead but I'd take it over this app."
138261,"Consistently FAILS to download files, can not name the files downloaded, can not choose into which sub-folder files are downloaded, can not search for images by image, consistently receiving error messages upon clicking links, webpages refusing to x-out when clicked appropriately, can not import/export bookmarks to/from other browsers, extremely user-unfriendly with an excruciatingly buggy UI. And I've had this app for less than a day! `Eff` this trash! Uninstalled!"
138263,"Why is this sending me notifications when background data is turned off. How is it fetching this info if it's set to BG data off in SYSTEM SETTINGS for this app? Privacy my axx. Haven't used this app in 3 days, yet there it is, just like every other stupid app in Google Play. You developers are all the same... It's all $$$."
138265,"i am use your app almost 9 hours and plz add ads blocker option brother thank you...."
138292,"It does not open, every time I open this app it not loading 😕"
138295,"The browser is too slow..."
138303,"I search duckduckgo website.. It shows, Web page not available🤣 What a great APP👌"
138321,"It's good for what it does and within its intentions, however after using it some time there's a few things that annoy me about it. The first one it the way it just takes you right back out of the search randomly when you press the back button. Say you go on images and press back sometimes it will take you back to the previous page, but others is takes you out completely and you have to type into the sesrch again. Also the keyboard changes layout when you open the app."
138338,"Mid range vote as I'm new to it, depending on its behavior in the coming weeks and months I might change it. So far, so good though!! 👍"
138342,"It works fine as a web browser, but you sometimes miss the search ability of google when using this, the part you've replaced. It is so much better to search for places around you, movie theaters times, weather, and specific information on google (to name a handful). For example, if you googled sunset it would give you the answer right there, but with this you go into search results to find the answer. So I guess what I'm saying is that you are compromising for track-free web browsing."
138345,"It's really fast, but I miss a couple of features. Pinning the menu bar on the bottom instead of the top, leaving the address bar at the top. Switching between tabs by swiping the address bar to the left or right. Quick button for bookmarking website's. Already used DDG as default search engine for years, so going to give this browser a try for the upcoming days/weeks. Also, open new tabs in the background. A quick button to open the startpage. A startpage with buttons to most visited pages."
138358,"This browser is really good for performance, speed and lightweight design. The only issue with it is desktop site feature is inconsistent. Sometimes it works fine but most of the websites it doesn't and most of means 2/10 websites loads successfully in desktop, rest remains in mobile view only. Hopefully it will be fixed and i hope duckduckgo will remain my default browser in future too."
138360,"I use it pretty much always, but it seems they intentionally remain generic quality. duckduckgo was getting better than Google, and then they got worse again. I have a theory. They're either using search algorithm writers that intentionally provide inferior algorithms, or they've got a deal with Google to retain an inferior search quality. There is a better. Google used to be it. If you learned how to put keywords correctly, and you were willing to look through it, you could find anything."
138371,"some time app stuck can't scroll fix problem"
138372,"If you could get rid of the tracking and monitoring of location the app would be great. Only people of faith and good morals should write apps."
138381,"One ,there is no way to disable it,uninstall is the only option. Two, when i try to switch back to Chrome ,this browser takes over. Until you get this fixed,with an option to disable..... i'm going to have to uninstall."
138404,"Good browser but if you have 75 -100 or more favorites / bookmarks in different categories it is too time consuming to scroll through the list. It's just a mass of disorganization. You might as well retype your search in the browser. It can be faster than scrolling the list. It's the only thing that turned me to another browser otherwise it would be my main choice. Can't compromise on this matter. Great otherwise."
138406,"I like the privacy, but it's function needs work. If I search for pictures, then click on one, then back, then click another, then back, etc, for some reason it seems to create a chain. If I wish you go back to the original search by hitting the back button, it will take be through the ENTIRE chain of pictures I clicked on. Normal browsers would essentially reset the chain if I looked at a picture and then hit back, so I wouldn't have to hit the back button a hundred times."
138418,"Decent browser, until you realize you can't export bookmarks or tabs. They also seem not to care about it, idk why this would be so difficult since they have to be stored in a file somewhere. The user can't access the data folder, and they even don't tell you where it is. Maybe it works manually if the phone is rooted. So yeah, don't collect bookmarks with this browser."
138435,"Ads were blocked, everything was cleared on exit; it seemed like I had found the perfect app to use and keep my searches private. But after a few months I started getting scam pop-ups. At first I dismissed it but now it has become a recurring issue and I can't seem to do any of my work without being instantly opened to another tab so someone can scam me. I'm very disappointed, this app had so much potential."
138444,"Ehh, it's fine I guess. Not the mega ass legend but it's ok enough. Sucks that it doesn't carry other valid websites, that's my most biggest criticism. Other than that, yeah, it's just a search engine that can allegedly block out El Creepos Google."
138447,"It's ok, but still need work on back function. Takes you to beginning rather than the previous screen at times. Slower than some, but the blocking features are nice."
138467,"A couple of things that I don't like.. when I click a link a new tab opens which is fine but when I'm done with said tab and press back it minimises the app. Instead you have to close the tab and then choose your previous one. Can pressing back just take you to the last tab?? Secondly, I'm in the UK and search results are never local. Presumably US related results. Other than that it's all OK."
138470,"Annoying that it seems obsessed with opening new tabs every time you click on a bookmark. Would be good to turn that off in the options. Also refresh by swiping down would be handy. Doesn't handle pdfs, "could not open file" error message"
138476,"its pleasant in a way that doesnt come off as creepy like big corporations do and also makes me feel safe and cool when i use it. my only problem is how small picture thumbnails are. on google its easy to see, but on duckduckgo thumbnails are so wide i feel like im peering through a backyard fence squinting and trying to figure out what im looking at."
138493,"Usage experience of this application is good so far. I have one suggestion though. When a PDF file is to be downloaded, it opens up in a new tab and that tab remains open. The developer may consider that when the link to any PDF file is tapped, then it doesn't open in a new tab but in an already existing tab, like it so happens in other brousers. Also a quick toggle gesture to switch between the tabs may also be considered."
138494,"I would like bookmarks toolbar please. Also extension add-on ability like ublock, Facebook container alike but maybe better? Other than that information, and options on blocking tracking, and cookies. This app has good potential but needs those few things to be. This browser has good potential, but unfortunately i cannot use it as main, because of these things."
138497,"Very bad, actually! Before and after updating, it's misleading to the first search, and canceling the previous. The app does not respond. It's a shame. It used to be quick as a ray and fast. Now is one more waste of time."
138513,"Where in the Hell is your Downloads Path? Why must i see an Anoyying duck every 5 mins? Why does everything i download end up unsuccessful, when other browsers have no issues with downloading? Why should i Use your Tedious UI? Where are any of the main, basic features a Web browser should have when even F***ing Opera has them?! All this Browser is good for, is a 6/10 Add block, and Security that even Mozzila has. Screw this. Uninstalled, almost after 30 mins in using it."
138539,"needs a bit more work..but it is a good app.."
138541,"Browser is good but why can't I edit the settings and make it so that every link opens in the same window instead of opening a new one every time? It gets tedious rather fast."
138543,"..the more users use it the refinement improves..takes a bit of getting used to but it's a principle I like; I'm seeing on my mobile how by stealth subliminal the internet passes messages and control duckduckgo may well be my go to once i am rid of mobile contracts; I'm so disgusted with the news the plagiarism voyeurism on mobiles to have something in media I can in someway control who knows what about me the better"
138544,"With every recent update this has just become worse and worse. It's now SO slow to load pages. It's at the point now where it's unusable. Been using DDG for years, sadly now though I must find an alternative."
138550,"Its streamlined and functions well, i feel safe and fancy free to browse :D I would give 5 stars but there aren't any options to print webpages or add helpful extensions, like to read webpages better or offline. It has to be my secondary browser bc of that, when i want it to be my primary. Its a bit slow too, but for what the browser does, it seems fast compared to something similar. Overall its a good browser for what it does and takes up next to no space on my phone :)"
138557,"I really want to love this browser but it's soooo slow. It means that I have to then use other browsers that I'm trying to avoid. Also I appreciate the incognito element but I would like to be able to copy and repaste into search bar, but have to always type in. Can there be a setting that allows you to copy/paste, at least during any session where you're continually active? Please help me to get the most out of this app as I really want to make it my main browser"
138566,"Changing my review form 5 stars to 2. I did really love this app but after the last update they moved everything to the top, and got rid of bookmarks quick access. Dont like i have fo reach all the way to the top, or the ekstra press to show bookmarks."
138572,"Still a good app but recent updates have me searching for another. Several updates ago changed opened tabs to tiles. More recently, opening images, links that open in new tab/windows and downloads open a tab that you have to manually close and then navigate back to the "active" tab. That's just annoying. Pressing back repeatedly use to close the "active" tab, then the app. Now, if you open multiple external links from email and then press back to the email, you end up with a bunch of open tabs."
138577,"Some basic things are missing - can't even share images. Downloaded images don't show in any folder. Extremely irritating browsing behaviour. Often when browsing within a site, clicking a link will open a new tab without obvious notification. When you try to navigate back, the tab just goes blank (surprising you, because you didn't know it opened a new tab) and you have to view all tabs to find the original site."
138578,"It's not bad. But needs a lot of work on it. I know they can improve on it as time goes on. I hope the next update will help us to hide our identity and were we are from because most of the website were able to locate my country and that is WRONG! I noticed that "some" adverts were able to bypass the security the app provide. But in all I think it's good."
138589,"Locks up a LOT, requiring close/reopen, oft repeatedly, apparently if it finds anything on a page it does not "like". May not ever open some pages other browsers handle just fine. Cannot save pages, pics, vids, or even highlight and save text from pages, in most cases. This reduced functionality supposedly needed to increase browser security? Not sure how much more secure it is, but it is barely a browser, in many ways."
138593,"Edit: Amened my review after checking results from panopticlick and others. Browser does have a unique fingerprint. And blocks only as many trackers as possible without breaking most websites. Some tracking is still possible. If it fits your needs use it. But it is a middle of the road solution. Much better than what most mainstream browsers offer out-of-the-box without add-on customization. Review is 1-star because the browser is marketed as private. Regarding funtionality it is quite good."
138619,"4.22.20. New update is no help. Here's a work around for the app's incompetence: When a web page hangs up (not if, when...) close all tabs and exit the browser. Restart. ...and in the 10 or 20 minutes since the first review DDG has crashed once, required a restart, and then took 30-60 seconds to load a simple web page. On my Samsung S10. You're headed quickly to a one star review and an uninstall, ducky. Really fast, as in about 24 hours if that can even be tolerated. Horrible browser."
138623,"Please improve your Video Player it is so disappointing"
138632,"The browser itself is great and easy to use. I've even switched to DuckDuckGo for my desktop search needs. It took a couple of weeks for me to realise why Google is the best. They have top notch SEO (search engine optimisation), and in this browser I rarely found what I was looking for through just typing it in the search bar. I had to go through Google. It would be nice if this browser had the option to set a default search engine but I see how that is unlikely."
138638,"I love the privacy, but the restriction defeats the purpose. The main reason why I installed a privacy-based browser was to, and I will shamelessly admit, browse NSFW pages. Now, so far it's been great. But when I search for "Adult" content, I can never see NSFW results in the other tabs besides "All", like "Images" and "Videos". Still a big problem as that's where I get most of my material. :/ Please fix this, or at least, show NSFW images and videos properly."
138639,"Well, thanks a lot. After a few months of use, I took the plunge and made this my default browser. Next, I spent far too much time creating shortcuts for the crucial sites to which I need quick and regular access. I downloaded the latest update and it erased all of those shortcuts. What a cool feature!"
138641,"I downloaded DuckDuckGo on all of my Android devices, and I'm quite enjoying it so far. I feel a lot more secure nowing that DuckDucGo blocks trackers and deletes my browsing history when I close the app. It is very fast, straight forward to use, and very accessible with the TalkBack screenreader for blind and visually impaired users. However, I'm only able to give it 3 stars as it's missing a very important feature - the ability to synchronize bookmarks across multiple devices. Please include!"
138642,"I love this app but for the past couple of months it freezes several times every day. All tabs freeze and it won't let me open anything in new tabs. I have to completely close the app and start over. I've done a system update and app update, and the problem still continues. Also the back button rarely takes you back to the last page and only opens a blank page. Pinterest links to open in browser no longer open in DuckDuckGo and redirect to a blank page."
138644,"DuckDuckGo randomly closes all my tabs. I can be reading a few pages, go to answer a WhatsApp message, and then all my tabs are gone, and all wiped off history. Outweighs any privacy advantages it might have had."
138654,"The address bar should either hide automatically after loading page or be fixed and not hide at all. Otherwise I can't see web page bottom bar which is sticked to the bottom of the page. It's super annoying. Especially when I use a web app, which has there an important feature like responding to a message contained in a bottom bar. In this case the element is "displayed" outside of the screen until I scroll up. It happens even if the page would fit perfectly in other browser without scrolling."
138655,"Seems okish. Hard to tell how private it really is, but seems to be better than Google or Samsung browsers in that regard. It loses 2 points, though, for not having a print feature. If I am trying to print or save files to PDF I have to go reactivate and use the non-private browser.. which largely defeats the entire point of having this app in the first place.. So I am considering uninstalling since I have to keep using the othes anyway. Plus the app is REALLY glitchy. Constantly crashing tabs."
138669,"So far, it seems to be okay though it has no add-on's. I want an ad blocker to use for YouTube because I'm fed up with all the commercials/ads!!"
138670,"Feeling really frustrated using this browser on my new Chromebook (I used DDG on my old Win10 system without a problem). Among other things, it seems to completely lack the right-click context menu e.g. I use 'open in new tab' extensively, and I'm really missing it. FWIW, Chrome on this new Chromebook does have the context menu."
138692,"My gripes: The new tabs page does not work well on a small screen, and with a slow processor. The creation of the thumbnails takes time, and the 'x' for deleting the tab is way too hard to hit with a normal finger. When returning to a page from the tabs page, the keyboard is often activated. *Very* irritating!"
138715,"Everything about this app is great but one thing that bothers me is when we press back button it goes to home menu or leave the app instead of going back to previous web page."
138717,"Where is the option to show download progress? This app is not user friendly. Switching between the tabs and reloading the page is a pain in the ass and frustrating. Page loading speed is good. The only reason I use this app is, it provides private browsing. So 3 stars!"
138720,"Major issues with using Youtube. I had to exit the page and open a new page every time I wanted to search something on Youtube. Eventually got tired of it and downloaded a new browser."
138727,"Amazing! Small app that runs smoothly. It's simple and convenient. There is one thing though. I can't download anything from the browser. Everything that I download is converted into a .bin file and my phone is unable to open it. I would appreciate if someone helped, since there aren't any solutions anywhere on the internet"
138758,"I love DuckDuckGo as a search engine. And set it as the default for my other browsers. I wish the Browser offered quite a bit more honestly... I've been testing a bunch of browsers to see which i like best. Edge and Bing have the rewards points which are cool. Then Osiris and Opera have amazing custimazation. Then I feel like Firefox, Epic and Startpage have Privacy tools rhat actually surpass DuckDuckGo browser... again i have DuckDuckGo set and the search engine for the other browsers"
138759,"Since the browser has messed up the autofill saves, how does one delete them and start again ? One thing that definitely needs to change is when one opens a link on one page, and a new tab opens to view the new page, when the back button is pressed the just opened tab should *NOT* just remain at the default view but should close and return the user to the tab where the link was pressed. Having to tidy up from this *every single time* is beyond all reason."
138774,"I would give this app 5 stars but just after Samsung did a firmware update I have not been able to download any types of images. I do not know if it is a compatibility issue. I had to do a master reset to my phone for it to work and then it will work for a couple of days then stop again. My phone company replaced the phone after the third time I called them about it and it is still doing it on the new phone. I really like DDG and use it on all my computers. Please look into this."
138789,"New self promotional jargon is annoying at best, completely unnecessary. This also interferes with other links. Example: when attempting to reach a link from Emails to eBay Duck Duck Go interferes with these new "at a boy" promotions. I've gone back to Google... Prior to this unwanted congratulatory verbage, I use DuckDuckGo exclusively as my search engine. Robert Luciano"
138795,"Works well when it works. Recent update (probably last two weeks) has caused intermittent crashes of the application when opening in-window options on webpages. Easy to replicate on any shopping site: the site will freeze and no other tabs will load past the halfway point. Only fix is to burn tabs and restart the whole app. Not currently usable."
138796,"Everything looked fine since I got the pop-up message: "Enjoying Duckduckgo?" And now it doesnt work anymore, its stuck at that point. Maybe it happens when there is an update? It happened again, and now after updating the problem looks solved."
138797,"Do you need to update your super slow app. I think so. You went from 5 stars to 3 stars. Update and maybe I will up it to 5 stars again, but not until you update."
138798,"This is not a good app. The search results are horrible and do not compare to Google's search results. Also, hitting the "back" button closes the app instead of bringing you back to the previous page. The UI is ugly, and there is no refresh button. Not much effort put into this at all. Inconvenient and clunky."
138809,"DDG is saving "filter by region" selection during search. There is no option or settings for this. It just saves! Even after the application is exit and apparently DDG says everything is cleared, how/where is this saved? Claiming to not track and then tracking is even WORSE than Google! Looks like DDG is not very different. I don't think I can trust DDG any more."
138810,"The interface is very slow. And if this app does not store data then why in the settings when I see this app's storage then it shows that there is some data stored. Apart from that in other search engines we can view the previously viewed tabs(if we have not removed them) but in this one is not able to do the same. Please resolve this issue otherwise I will be forced to uninstall this app"
138811,"Basically quite a nice browser, with some good features to protect one's privacy. However: * The concept of feedback categories as (positive / negative) and the practice to avoid negative feedback on the playstore by only redirecting positive feedback there are very dishonest * for some websites it might necessary to permanently store cookies / web storage /etc., e.g. to stay logged in. It would be great, if websites could be excluded from reset * A password manager would be nice"
138814,"I really want to use this browser. Unfortunately it is unusable due to the absence of forward or back buttons while browsing. Super useful and well designed mobile browser otherwise. Lack of this feature is like using a car with no reverse gear or a bicycle with no seat."
138832,"It's really good But there's one problem. Everytime i open a new tab. To read a recipe or something else. And when i close the tab and want to go back to the page i was on before it goes white and don't do anything. And it takes several minutes and when i have pressed back several times it goes back to start"
138836,"Works fine. Dont like the search bar being loaded with an ad. But other than that it is good. Would like to know more about how to go adless"
138839,"It's great but when i'm surfing in a certain website and want to go just to the previews page where i was the browser takes me to a blank page or to a new tab, i don't understand that, it's annoying"
138842,"All in all it's a good app and going to get better it could use a few more short cuts and livened up a little and a few more things to keep the interest going.but it seems to be going in the right direction.just don't get so big you loose yourself and what you originally set out to do."
138844,"Back doesnt work... If u press back to go to previous web page. Instead... It opens a new blank tab. Extremley annoying. Worked fine a few months ago. I habe tested this now on 2 totally different android phones. Same issue. Now the browser is basically useless. Emailed support twice about it and nobody bothers to reply."
138845,"Editing my former 5-star rating I initially wrote after 4 months of use. It's been a few more months and I now constantly go back to google chrome, though I don't want to. The ONLY reason I tend to use chrome is because swipe texting + auto complete are unusable in DuckDuckGo's search bar. In Chrome, spaces are auto inserted after words, but that doesn't happen in this app, making searching very hard. If this is fixed, I believe I can finally quit google, and will restore my 5/5 review."
138848,"Adequate browser, great tracking blocker, but....the tool bar is at the bottom and not movable. Very annoying. Should be at the top. Also, descriptions...totally lacking. There's a flame icon on the toolbar-what does it do? To scared to press....lol. Overall, no major issues. 5 stars...after some minor tweaks."
138888,"No microphone makes this app almost useless"
138889,"It's a nice browser. I like the rating you give to each website. However the user experience is not the greatest. I need to click two times to refresh the page and also click two times to change tab. If you could have the drag image to refresh like chrome and the changing tab like in opera you will get a lot more users"
138898,"I like the privacy aspect and the animated duck which appears with a message warning when anomalies or privacy threatening activities are detected. still assessing the experience though."
138901,"Very disappointed. I've been happily using the browser for a few months when today my browser icon disappeared from my phone. I tried in vain to create another one. I was forced to uninstall and then reinstall the browser app. I have lost all of my bookmarks! I'm very upset by this. I've also noticed changes in the browser so I'm wondering if this happened due to an update?"
138902,"Slightly slower but i have no problem with a lil less speed vs more privacy, why did the search bar stop showing what sites were trying to track me and you stopping them I actually like seeing what noisey trackers were being stopped! Revision: it would appear you aren't as forthcoming as I was led to believe and I have had to stop using your browser"
138921,"It recently began blocking my ability to load comments on some but not all sites. The error given is "We detected some connectivity issues, therefore, we’re unable to load Conversation". Other than this issue, it is or was my preferred browser. Please fix."
138926,"Good to have at least one browser that is privacy oriented. However following features are required for better experience: Videos should not auto-play; Gesture to navigate between open tabs; Ability to open a new website from bookmarks in an existing tab (currently opens a new tab); Tabs opened in background should load the links automatically; Loading a site on an empty tab via bookmarks & then pressing back just closes the browser instead of going back to the empty tab"
138936,"I've been using duck duck go as my primary mobile browser for the past few weeks and have really enjoyed it. Despite this, one feature that I feel is missing is the ability to make folders for bookmarks, it would have helped so much in keeping things organized."
138937,"Still no text only mode/simple mode and the bottom tool bar cant be reverted back to the traditional layout.... I mean the mapping is just not logical. After the update it kept lagging when scrolling(frequently lags). Re-installed this for the 4th time now and lagging persists, did a reboot too and cleared data/storage and cache lot of times It's not my phone's problem cause brave browser doesn't lag and that browser requires more juice to run. *Update: UI and UX sucks now. Using Via now"
138941,"When you search for something, it pulls up a bunch of other sites that has nothing to do with what your searching for....I want to see pics, options, and other links that I can click on. You don't want us to use Google because of privacy issues so you make your browser sound like a good option. Well here is an idea, make it more like Google with options, pics, etc and we would stray away from Google!"
138952,"Everythings fine. But please add a download extension where we can see our downloads"
138958,"Ooh. Adware. My daughter tried to warn me. I would turn notifications off. For your app. But. I haven't had to do that. For any other mobile browser. Ever. "We've got you covered. You've got this. You can browse safely" or some crop like that. Other dopier messages. I don't like pointless notifications. Don't need em. Your browser isn't tor anyway. Quite useless. Uninstalling. Microseconds. After posting this. You are immature dimwits. Cheers."
138960,"Please, instead of forcing this compromised browsing experience, simply make it a search engine, with an alternative widget to that of the scroogle search bar. That way, it shows results in it and when I tap a link, it just opens in my favorite and most feature packed web browser; Samsung Internet. I just want quick access to the DuckDuckGo search engine via a widget on my home screen, not for it to compromise my browsing experience. Better yet, make a separate app for that. Thanks."
138971,"These past updates r EXACTLY what we DON'T need! Why add "fireproof" list, sites change constantly. These are STILL no... "open in same/new tab" option, homepage, quick way to close tabs, static address bar, bookmark organization or folders. You have stupid icon colors as an option, but not the stuff above. You also added an annoying animation to the address bar, which completely blocks out the site name until its done playing. Still using firefox until you get with the times. F**king A guys!"
138972,"Its sad to see that a company that follows ethical and moral standards, has such a poor performance with respect to their apps. There are so many bugs that are quite irritating and frustrating to deal with, especially for the mobile browser. Personally, I didn't have any issues with the web browser. But the search hits are not what I aim for, and unfortunately, have to look towards the company's main rivals in the market (Google, to be exact). Please improve your search query hits as well!"
138989,"Improved URL animation? An update? Prior: DDG is great and all, but do not make it intrusive. I never ASKED for my "privacy report" from DDG. If I had wanted it, I would have opted in for that. But - It's NOT AN OPTION, *and* there's no place to TURN IT OFF. We get pushed notifications all the time - we don't want them. It's invasive to get things pushed on you. Please remove this "feature", or make it optional, with OPT-IN being a requirement."
138993,"The browser is buggy when browsing through images and makes the entire experiance broken. You are forced to view the image upclose without any option to reduce image size and stay in one spot of the image. You can't view the entire image as a whole. Terrible Browser, seen better designs elsewhere."
139001,"I like the idea of a privacy browser, but i find it's not as fluid as Google. At times links on websites don't load, or the transition to a different site is not smooth or it stalls. Also if trying to print something from my phone or save it as a pdf, that option is not available."
139003,"(No) thanks DDG for a pop-up after a few days ("Enjoying DuckDuckGo? We'd love to know what you think. A: It needs work/ I Iike it"). This TOTALLY FREEZES THE APP AND MY ENTIRE PHONE, can't be cancelled & reappears every time I open the app! Is it meant to link to G-Play to write a review?. I can't do ANYTHING on my phone for ~30s until Android rescues me with "DuckDuckGo? isn't responding: do you wish to close it?" So the app is now UNUSABLE! That's quite an achievement! Not good at all guys…"
139004,"Don't update!!!! Was a really great app.... The update wiped out all my links on the home page! I had several dozen, will take some time to replace, I will use the Chrome app instead, it has never wiped out favorites saved on the home page. You guys blew it."
139056,"Recycled change log. Rinse and repeat.!!!!"
139060,"Works well. The notification that appears when you start the browser about "You've got this! Every time you browse with me a creepy ad loses its wings" is really annoying and patronizing. Please get rid of it. I'm kind of embarrassed for the person who thought that was a good idea."
139064,"Not showing proper mobile version of web"
139072,"If it's replacing Google, it needs to diversify and update search results. So far, Duck's showing negative press by tabloids mainly and not the rest i.e. Prince Harry and Meghan. Duchess of Sussex"
139075,"The app and privacy it offers is great. I am not a fan of the closing out apps moved to the top instead of the bottom of the screen as previously."
139076,"Please add dark web page features as well..it would be great."
139105,"first time in different as to how the app looks. Second I'm disappointed that the app kills the microphone on the keyboard so that I cannot talk and text. Make the microphone on the keyboard available with the app. Then maybe I'll use the app again."
139123,"I love the app it doesn't save the tabs for too long so it doesn't have a pileup of old tabs Will be five-star when the bottom 2 is added •Please just add a single more layer to the bookmarks free tip here you can call it shelves •make it stop instantly closing the tabs on moto"
139127,"The browser is very outdated and doesn't block ads. When an ad opens a new tab with a click, its hard to get back to previous tab i was browsing. Instead of bringing back to the previous tab. This browser closes the application and exits to home screen. This irritates a lot. Uninstalling.."
139131,"Browser is fine. Reasonably fast have not had a crash yet. Biggest problem is when on a page, hitting the back button to go back to a previous page, instead the browser always goes to the home page. Super annoying, and I use this browser less and less."
139132,"I like that it stops the other sites from tracking my activity. It does need a little compatibility work with some apps such as Spruce which my Naturopath doctor's office uses for purchases"
139133,"Difficult to refresh web pages"
139135,"1st: if DuckDuckGo doesn't save data, why is there 23MB saved in app storage after I have been online, and more added each time I use it. I can understand cache data, but this is not cache. 2nd: since the last update which I did not down load, the icon for this app is gone so now it doesn't open at all. If I am being forced to update this app in order to use it, it is time for uninstall. I just updated to see if it would work.Still no icon, still won't open still uninstalling"
139142,"Lots of bugs, not as smooth and powerful as other browsers eg. I use Google search engine as their search engine doesn't work most of the time."
139147,"• I live in New Mexico and "find a store near me" puts me in N. LV, NV • Incognito mode will not allow voice to type mode- must hand type when using research bar • No instructions on how to turn incognito mode on and off • Love not getting ads popping up from an inquiry made 1 time by my son 3 years ago"
139150,"Literally no option to turn off autoplay on site videos, which are, besides privacy violations, the most annoying issue with websites. Find another browser until DuckDuckGo implements the basic ability to block autoplay by default. And no way to turn off JavaScript. Both these flaws make this browser all but useless."
139157,"This app doesn't block trackers I'm getting the same scam mail I will be deleting it and getting something that shows it's working, it always says zero block, when I know for sure I'm still unsafe, it doesn't do it explain anything about it when I click on it, I gave it one star that's low as I could go, I feel like it's just another app taking storage space, it's not doing anything here as I can see, then I tried reading reviews before download no chance"
139170,"i love the browser just some problems i am un able to access some sites Which are easy to open using Chrome or any other browser to acces that i have to use a vpn with this browser , can u do something about it"
139173,"The back arrow goes back to home and I have to find the tab again and reopen. When I tried to leave feedback through your play store link, it just did a web search for feedback. Ridiculous. The auto blocking of trackers makes me want to keep this around but if I can't even use the back button then this belongs in the trash."
139188,"This app was working fine for me for awhile but for some reason now everytime I search literally anything on the browser I can't scroll down. I'm limited to the first couple options given to me which are always ads and not useful. I'm uninstalling and going to another anonymous browser until this is fixed."
139194,"Great for everything but video which stutters even at 360p. I needed a browser that would allow me to watch YouTube without using the app."
139199,"It only works for one day after installation.. Dissapointed"
139207,"Does what it says with privacy and that's good. But everything else is rubbish. Browsing experience feels outdated."
139222,"Needs a bit of work. It has a bug on websites that makes the words big and lap over each other and can't read it or click what you want to go into."
139224,"The Key board is hit and miss to come up when tapping in a search box. Back issue still happening, browser seems to go stale randomly where it doesnt do anything, all the buttons respond so it's not frozen but they dont do anything no pages will load have to completely close all tabs and close the browser right out and start over. Lots of major bugs still need worked out."
139238,"Its okay but it doesn't always stop websites tracking you plus if you're using a Web browser on PC it hardly works at all and it doesn't warn you on what websites are bad for tracking and what are good :/"
139241,"When I do a search directly through this app a lot of time I get no hits. I can take the same exact search and search on Firefox with duckduckgo as the default search engine and I get lots of hits. Evey time I open the app it wants me to verify who I am when no other browse does this Uninstalling"
139245,"My wifi strength is strong... But i am unable search ..... After searching it come out to be webpage not available"
139253,"Every time I go to use it , it kicks me right off the second it loads , fix the problem and I will re-rate your app, until then I'll keep using chrome"
139263,"No home page - at least none that I can find - so no way to have favorite sites easily available. I switch around a lot so this is a problem for me. I sent feedback about it so hopefully it will be in a later version. For now, this doesn't meet my needs so I'll move on."
139280,"So much nicer and better thought out than the chrome browser, especially when you open multiple tabs. *UPDATED Review - after an update, my phone woke me up in the middle of the night with a notification from duck duck go to show me a very self congratulatory 'privacy report' of how many cookies it's blocked, ironic from a browser that's about privacy. This rubbish shouldn't be pushed as a notification."
139283,"The app has difficulty with yahoo mail and page refreshing. Trying to go "back" often sends you to the DDG home page. Its come a long ways but still needs work."
139291,"I don't trust this at all. Been using it for a week and I've had more targeted ads etc popping up in my emails and social media for things that I've specifically searched for on this browser than I ever had using google. Also my Netflix account was hacked 3 days after downloading this app and I only very recently changed my password to a very secure password and it immediately gets hacked after using this app. Be very careful"
139294,"The App is Ok. But I think and request the developer to make it like other browsing features like that of chrome but with security and privacy ... Yes data is important but also give added features and beta updates of new competitors like chrome canary etc ... At least some basic add-ons should be given like Good UI detail saver but local saved and encrypted and"
139310,"It's time to uninstall this browser as it has lost most of its quality and has become add focused browser. Thanks for ur service, I liked it a lot but can't stand a good browsing experience because of the pop-up add on every click."
139312,"Business searches don't make phone numbers one-click entries, and the results aren't always what I'm looking for (and am able to find with other search engines), but I like the movement to take control of our data."
139319,"WARNING THIS APP IS NOT A VPN! This app is only good for searching data on the Duckduckgo site, it offers absolutely NO privacy when visiting other websites and compromises your privacy. This app is utterly useless for searching the web for information. They're latest policies have killed any uniqueness they had. Duckduckgo is just a standard search engine now, one you can visit with any other browser for the same "privacy" effect. This app is pointless."
139323,"Poor effort. Who in their right mind thought "i know, everytime a user does anything we'll have a notification that slooooowly appears on the screen and has to be cleared before they can do anything else, even viewing the site they went to in the first place"? Really? What a joke. Looks like im stuck with google until someone cracks this obviously hugely difficult task of viewing a web page on a mobile and it not being a frustrating experience."
139332,"Downloading attachments is a problem"
139344,"Listen, this apps ad on youtube stated that google was targeting you with ads, but they dont understand a feature about google, youtube, and Facebook that allows you to turn personalized ads off. Instead of trying to tell people that they can turn personalized ads off to be safe, they made an app about it to profit off the apps popularity, this whole thing just proves that you cant trust anyone, including the people who "are trying to help""
139346,"back button from a newly-opened tab does not take you back to the original page/tab that you started from. while the browser has some nice features, until this issue is fixed, the app is unusable."
139352,"Images are a little disappointing because this app doesn't show similar images under them. Otherwise a decent app mainly because of it cares about privacy (unlike one specific company lol)."
139357,"I have the Bitdefender Total Security 2020 mobile app which also includes an anti-virus software. The DuckDuckGo browser is not on the protected browser list so I no longer using it."
139361,"Hi, love app but fyi, it still wont open from homepage, I am using latest version of android on Samsung Galaxy Note 9. Yes! They have share function👍😉 I use this search engine for any serious research that is scrubbed by Google. Thank you for keeping it real👏👏👏"
139391,"Browser is good for what it does but could be improved 1-- refresh button should be more accessible 2-- auto reload when lost connection is regained (but not that pull down to refresh in chrome please) 3-- data saving by image compression maybe 4--downloading is not reliable"
139399,"This was an excellent app. Now it doesn't work at all! Can't resolve any website. Please FIX IT!"
139400,"I couldn't find the songs I downloaded from a site into my phone. I checked every folder in my phone. They don't exist. UPDATE: Downloads are still not downloading as of 4-25-20. The site says my songs are successfully downloaded but this browser does not download them."
139406,"Works as it says if I use it in English. When I try to find something in my native language (dutch) it keeps giving me a lot of irrelevant English results. Still use it as much as possible because of the privacy perks, but in Dutch I still use google sometimes."
139411,"I love this browser before the update! I hate the new floating menu bar 😭 I know that floating bar looks more simple and stylish or whatever, but previous lower bar is much more accessible, considering Android devices of today are 6' or more! Floating menu bar is TROUBLESOME."
139416,"It is a great app but there is a lot of room for improvement like, its needs to include an option to block ads and a buffer booster for online videos with on screen controls to adjust volume and brightness."
139433,"I just went from five stars to 1. I updated the app recently and my tabs and bookmarks have disappeared I can't get to them unless I do a search for something else and then they pop up. I have written to the developer twice and they don't answer me."
139453,"I can do audio for the review but I can't do audio for anything else"
139455,"when opening some link DDG shows up blank. is only until i return to previous page then hit the link again and then I'm sent to the site. very frustrating s9 Update: 5/2020 isn't auto clearing on "app exit". Adjusted settings. I have to manually hit the flame icon to clear."
139469,"Every time you hit the back button you have to start your search ALL OVER. Even if your in a map trying to get the correct location entered. It's more time consuming and aggravating than it's worth."
139487,"Good browser. I rated only three stars and will increase it to five if the developers add in a way to better organize bookmarks. I would like to see a drop-down menu like Google Chrome and Internet Explorer have for organizing bookmarks."
139488,"No tracking ,safe, secure, privacy but there are some issues that needs to be fixed"
139493,"When back press app is closing instead of back"
139504,"The browser is quite slow sometimes. Please make it better. Thank You!!!! I like knowing that my search is private. That what I search for is not spread throughout the Internet. Will continue to use for my Internet needs and trash Google."
139526,"Not sure if or how privacy is better or different but I'd change it to 4 or 5 stars if they would fix it to where when you select open in new tab it didn't close tab your in and jump to new tab if it did it like chrome or Firefox where it opens new tab but keeps you on same page or at least have option of doing it that'd b so much better"
139529,"Great concept, buy very unfinished. No bookmark importing/exporting, no voice inputs because keyboards (Gboard) think it's "in private browsing mode", sites don't redirect to their app counterparts, many sites not supported."
139548,"This browser does not appear to have a download option. That's very odd and, unfortunately, means that I am unable to use this otherwise excellent browser."
139574,"Rating 3 stars because it's the best browser ever, this is much better than Chrome, i rated 3 stars because everytime i go to google and look up something, and look up an another one, it keeps messing up and enters the same search that i went to 😞 Do the best you can, stay safe 💚"
139585,"There is ad blocks but there is no stopping from auto pop-ups and redirecting ad sites. Ur ad block works on the ads that are present on current page only. Not the lots of sites ot loading ehile entering to a website. Anyhow I loved the app."
139586,"Nice minimalistic browser, but please add an option to shift the toolbar at the bottom side so that it becomes much easier to switch the tabs. And please add a offline-page feature, the lack of which keeps me using chrome. That's why keeping two remaining star."
139598,"Used to work great. Now, after the most recent update, it has stopped working. It never loads any web page, ever. It gets stuck loading at the halfway point and never proceeds"
139608,"So far I have to say it performs as good as chrome and Samsung browser. Samsung pass seems to work with it. Convenient. Haven't explored all features yet. Hope it's as user-friendly as Samsung."
139623,"Took over. Very annoying."
139631,"Overall the browser is good at maintaining privacy and blocks trackers but the tab menu is so dam ugly that it sucks! The fire 🔥 button is good concept but doesn't work for everyone! Add some new features like Swipe to next tab And the setting menu is also ugly plz take a look over it!"
139642,"Need some minor bug fixes"
139663,"Useless app. I wanted to switch from chrome to this browser but it just don't work properly. Many sites don't even open, some features like filling forms and logging in don't work. Clicking Instagram links doesn't open instagram app. This app is just garbage to browse internet."
139673,"Need additional features Give features like pull down to refresh and don't open search links in New tabs always. Give a toggle to do that. Thanks"
139681,"It lacks: save file as/save link as, print, etc. It only works as a reader, can't download files that lack a download button. Works to read the paper. Needs save, print, etc functions."
139688,"Duck Duck go more like duck duck scam. This app makes me feel miserable for even using it. The app doesn't even feel right and it doesn't even work! The app is creepy and it is so creepy that it's ads follow me every regularly!!!! Google sends ads on YouTube so Youtuber's can make money. I hate however the fact that Duck duck go ads keep following me! Just to clarify the ads of Google are getting worse following people by interest. Interestingly enough this app is run by Google but hey right😡"
139717,"performance could be better, the scroll wheel sometimes just bugs out won't scroll down beyond a certain point, forcing me to refresh the page i'm currently on, but overall pretty good."
139738,"This is a good concept but unfortunately google still track you. Whenever I've used chrome for whatever reason, all the searches I made on this app were listed in order in chrome's history. So you can't escape it, you still get tracked."
139741,"Annoying how I cannot stop it being the default browser. If I am in chrome, a link will open in DDG. I don't want it to but have no option. Switching off Default Browser in DDG does nothing and is still set when I next check."
139746,"New problem since last update. When doing a search, if you click a link to a page and then want to go back to the search results, it takes you to a blank page. You have to reenter search terms and start over."
139758,"Everything is damn gud but the app is not stable.. if i use few tabs at the same time and then the tabs shows the home page when i go out and comes in. It's fishy and ridiculous. Plea make it stable as possible. Thanks in advance"
139761,"I recently uninstalled uc browser for security issues. The best thing about uc is the way it provides option to download all videos streamed. Please add that feature then 5 star guaranteed. Also a strong ad pop-up blocker like brave browser."
139764,"Love almost everything about it except if you have a long list of results to search and you click a link, when you go back to the results you are taken back to the initial page of results and have to scroll through the results all over again. So frustrating."
