135175,"Yet to be seen so far awesome I haven't used it much. The only thing that I miss is the speaker. I can't use my voice to type. It's so much quicker to be able to talk to your phone. When doing searches. That's all you need to do is figure out a way to add this it is a must for me to continue on DuckDuckGo. Otherwise it would be a five-star review*****."
135177,"An excellent option for privacy minded users who want a no nonsense, no frills experience (like Firefox users who don't like the Daylight upgrade). Those desiring a more complete and well rounded experience should look for either Vivaldi, Brave, or the aformentioned Firefox (my personal favorite), but those who find those experiences overwhelming or unsatisfying for whatever reason should be happy with this, especially if they like the browser extension for desktop."
135183,"NOT PRIVATE, ALLOWS PHOTOS OF PAGES, AND DIALOG BOXES FREEZE PAGES! If you can ask me if a page should have access to my location YOU ARE NOT PRIVATE! Unscrollable dialog boxes to reject request, by font size is unacceptable. These are simple and standard code! You can't do this right? ALLOWS PRIVATE PAGES TO BE SCREENSHOT! You can, I won't!"
135186,"9/8 All of the sudden your browser is allowing a webpage I visit, daily, to show a preview of five of their headlines in a popup window. Stop that. 9/10 My tabs are still closing randomly. Stop that as well. 9/12 Seriously, you have to stop closing my tabs. I will close them when I chose to close them."
135188,"Latest version search from the address bar gives a blank page. Workaround is to touch the A icon top left the back arrow. Great private browser but really needs forced page zoom option."
135213,"Not Private At All!!! I've searched something and saved to my bookmarks. When I go back 2 search something else the moment I type first letter IT SHOWS UP RECENTLY ADDED BOOKMARKS UNDER THE SEARCH TAB exposing it 2 everyone. How private it is? I want to search something but don't want people that are looking at my phone to see my last added bookmarks or any other sorts of suggestions, history? I thought this search engine is to keep your privacy hidden... I was wrong."
135236,"I love the app, but I'm tired of having to constantly re-download it because after a certain amount of searches (not many at all) all the rest will just show up as "Webpage not available" and it will have a bunch of other stuff, and the only way to fix this that I've found is un-installing it and installing it back. I've pretty much just stopped using it because of this, it is VERY annoying. I like the service, but not the glitch."
135238,"App (and webpage) used to be great. Recently though, the search results have gotten awful. When I'm shopping, I like to shop. When I'm looking for adjustment or repair procedures for something I've already bought, that is what I want to see. The search results used to reflect this. Now, almost all of the results are, "buy, buy, buy". When I'm looking for the procedure to program the key fob for my car, I don't want to see result after result trying to sell me a new car."
135254,"Has issues signing into websites using Google, Facebook, etc. It also has issues downloading and opening PDFs. When I attempt to log in using Google, it just switches to a different tab and then the website states there was a problem logging me in. When I try it on Chrome, I have no problems. The same happens when downliading a file. The browser also can't handle several websites. It'll crash or not connect to the site."
135270,"Trash. It looks good and all but it's very terrible to use. It has glitches sometimes you can't scroll up it just reloads the page when you try to. Desktop version of sites never works. There are known issues with the searches from desktop version anyway same thing here, many images, links, local sites not having priority in search. Wrong meaning of privacy, it can't do what you want cause that would do what duckduckgo does: limit the browser, searches. Going back to stock browsers. :)"
135271,"Really tested this app to see its capabilities. Good so far with some complaints. It doesn't block pop ups very well. Pop ups get through as another tab opened in the background. I haven't found a setting for that yet. Also, backing out doesn't bring you to the original search page, which sucks. Playing videos within the app won't allow for auto landscape/portrait adjustment. Overall, the app is ok, but I would really like to see more improvements."
135275,"I like this browser for the most part, but recently it has been freezing frequently, hence only two stars. I use it in combination with PIA VPN. [I mention this only because it might be relevant to the browser freezes.] Also, is there a way to disable drag-down refresh? It's really annoying to try to scroll down while typing into a text field, only to refresh instead and have to restart the entire text entry. (TIA)"
135276,"Honestly, I was loving DuckDuckGo. I used it for all my web searches. But ever since the recent update, I haven't been able to search anything. It keeps showing"error : name not resolved" and doesn't give any results even with a perfectly fine network connection. I'm sorry, but I can't give a 5 star rating unless the app does what it's supposed to. Devs, fix this."
135283,"I like it, the privacy and info it provides... but on my phone it's hard to use. It opens so many pages in a new window, I have a hard time finding where I am. Sometimes I look up and I'll have 15-20 separate windows open and I have to close them all. Also, wish I could turn on the ability to use my microphone for speech to text. I realize the privacy issues but sometimes I need to get a long message in and can't sit there and any type it all in on my phone. Too much work, back to Chrome."
135290,"Devs, please fix this, when I type in a search bar on YouTube, or any other site that has a search bar, my key typing app works once, but then after the second time, when I click the search bar, my typing app does not show and it's only when I use duck duck go. Google never has this problem as my keyboard on my phone always works, it stops working when using ur browser, please fix that urgently. I always have to close ur browser and then re open it for my typing app to work, SwiftKey app."
135296,"I really like this browser. However it has a lot of options and features that I don't understand. I am learning as I go, but I've already lost tabs I wanted to keep by having chosen the wrong setting. My fault but still annoying. I do really LOVE the fact that it shows me the trackers it has blocked and that it can make whatever sight I'm on safer. Will upgrade stars when and if I figure out how to use this browser effectively. Overall a really nice, fast browser."
135297,"Hello, I have been using DuckDuckGo for quite a longer time. It has been a nice experience while surfing through internet with privacy been protected as well. There are few things that make this browser outdated: 1. The image files are downloaded in '.bin' format while almost all phone galleries support '.jpeg' or '.jpg' format. This thing is terribly wrong and spoils the taste of internet surfing. 2. Unlike Google Chrome there is no option of downloading the page for offline view."
135311,"Only just installed. Seems fast enough. Irritating messages telling you how good the app is. Being different it will take some time to get used to, if I last that long through those messages. Uninstalled due to irritating messages. Search results seemed to be a bit on the light side, but maybe I am used to receiving irrelevant sesrch results (more but irrelevant)."
135317,"Privacy is awesome but this browser has some trade offs that make it not as enjoyable. It's missing the mark on UX. Down swipe from the top on the page to reload like Chrome is a staple in the browser experience. This could be 10x better if the reload button was a quick button like the tabs or flame button. Swipe to switch tabs (Chrome) should be considered as well. I guess I'll stick to Chrome and a VPN for now."
135328,"Whoever wrote the recent changes screwed up the program! Crashes repeatedly and even causes my tablet to reboot. What a shame, it was my favorite before but now its almost too annoying to use. My latest issue is the program locking up on startup - black screen with no way out. Uninstalled and reinstalled, now my bookmarks are gone."
135330,"This app was amazing at some point because it was smooth and true to it's word about privacy but about a month ago it started making my screen flicker and glitch. It only seems to happen with this app and I have few other apps that I use in a daily but this one has honestly began to disappoint me. I deleted it and reinstalled it to see if it would fix but it remains with it's flickering, I would improve my review if the issue can be fixed, I really did love this app at some point."
135332,"It doesn't work sometimes, randomly. Search for some page, progress bar is moving, nothing happens. Check the same page in chrome - all is ok. Go back to duckduck page not opening. So this something with duck search. It hangs for no reason. You have to fix that."
135337,"constant slow loading speed, empty search results, links not working and limited settings ruin this app. I thought this ran on bing's search engine, but compared results tell a different story. The results I do get, I'm only able to actually click on 1/4 of them without toggling the privacy protection to load them. Now it's making me leave the app and come back in. It's very annoying doing that on repeat for clicks that are incredibly delayed and turn the page white from not loading. Broken...."
135343,"Good, but could be better, some things don't load on certain sites, there not dodgy sites either. Some sites won't load at all, I.e my girlfriends NHS site for blu light card won't work on duck duck go so she has to use google. When I click on the search bar on some sites my keyboard won't pop up to type, I have to exit, and reopen duck duck go, this never happens on Google, but I don't want to use the corrupt google so I'll pit up with these little niggles. 5 stars if you can sort these out."
135345,"Very good browser with some common features missing. Namely... * pull down to refresh the page * Options to put bookmarks or favourites or frequently visited or recently visited or SOMETHING on the new tab homescreen. EDIT: Also, no 'share to printer' feature, and a list of 'valid domains' pops up randomly in a window, covering the keyboard. Furthermore, 'back' from a tab with no history just goes to a blank page, rather than closing the tab and returning to the previous one."
135348,"Sadly I had to uninstall this app. I attempted to use it with doxy and it blocked my camera and microphone. Doxy instructed me to change my browser settings however when I attempted to do so duck made no Provisions for me to do so. Firefox is in the dumper. It seems like the choices for a reliable browser or diminishing daily"
135356,"Not so great search results and the videos will not play on any website I go to such as Daystar television or even Amazon videos advertising a product. I really like the idea of not having my every move tracked but i very much enjoy Daystar and may have to go back to Google or safari or firefox to watch it. I will add that certain websites have functioned with increased speed which is definitely a plus."
135358,"It's a wonderful app in general however there are times when it wont load and I have to go back to using chrome. It would also be lovely if there was a feature on here where I can use the microphone on my keypad to do talk to text. Thanks"
135361,"Sorry new update doesn't allow me to go through duckduckgo search directly, instead I have to type each website completely then it opens up. I believe it's a bug. And also the theme previously had a different choices to have a look but now we don't get it please allow us to enable different theme setup in the list of personalizing the app as it was in the previous version of the app. There is still lot of bugs in this version"
135367,"Love the DDG team, and have been an ardent supporter since day one oh so many years ago. But there is no plugin framework, so uMatrix and uBlock functionality are not available. If you are used to a beautiful internet free of ads and malicious redirects, this browser cannot yet deliver until they add script management. If you love ads and getting irreversibly punted out of sites with dodgy scripts, and just want a modest privacy improvement, DDG browser is for you. Hope they improve it!!"
135369,"Having an issue downloading pictures or files recently. Downloads unsuccessful all the time now. Didn't have this issue when I first installed this app. Otherwise a great app. Update: downloading issue corrected, but now downloaded files can't be moved to another folder or posted to social media."
135370,"So far so good 3 stars because it ask for a rating a bit too early in my time of exp. However i wd certainly like to take the time to thank the developers for recognizing a need, then building a product around that need, then adapt and overcome the many hurdles of red tape that exists in the worlds microsoft, android, and mac, who all lately seem so hell bent on in your face repeated onslaught advertising, no longer trying to weed out the scammers, just sell sell sell. Will edit to 5 stars later"
135372,"Good browser..but some areas where it lags tonuc browser: 1. It doesn't provides zoom in feature in a page wherein the font size and the matter adjusts to page width only, one doesn't have to swipe right and left to read time and again. 2.basic feature such as history bar, so one can search any older webpage. 3.no download section to refer downloaded files directly. So developers, not just speed matters, in this competitive world , you have to be on ur toes"
135377,"I love that it keeps trackers at Bay, and maybe I'm missing it but. When I do a search I have to open a new search window sometimes I can't just hit 'home' or 'back' to go back to he search page, ,it's a little frustrating. But so far so good."
135395,"Changing my rating down to one star after recent updates. Pages sometimes dont load at all, links do not work when tapped on sometimes. Now having to tap on links multiple times for them to open. This needs to be checked. I'm on a fully updated Sony Xperia XZ1 Compact running Android 9."
135397,"Good search engine but the dark mode doesn't apply automatically to the search part of the app. Always having to set the search page to dark theme manually is extremely tedious especially when you've already selected dark mode in the app itself. If this wasn't so frustrating I'd probably give it 5 stars."
135404,"I like what the browser is trying to do as far as personal security goes. However without text wrap where you can zoom in on the page and have the text reflow to fit it is pretty much useless who can read text says microscopically small. And who wants to stretch the text only to have to scroll side to side to read it hopefully they will address this soon if not it's pretty much useless to me"
135409,"Really love this browser, but one thing need to be update, make video download easy way like UC browser. When I paste a link for video in UC browser it will ask for download option with in a second. In Duck Duck Go never asks that, it directly playing the video, it is take too time to play or download. So this is my suggestion. After it will be my perfect browser. Thankyou"
135413,"Sometimes it blocks important documents that I need, i guess it thinks that they are spam and they actually are not...i have a choice rather to accept duckduckgo or not...not the choice to accept duckduckgo but also accept my documents as well...i hope im clear...is there a way to accept duckduckgo and also accept certain documents....i really do like the app though"
135423,"The search results seem to be fewer than those provided by Google, and yet they match the search string less precisely. The browser also seems to be much slower to load pages, particularly noticeable with pages containing video."
135425,"I really like what you guys do but to be concurrence to google you really have to improve your search engine. Get inspiration from google mechanisms. Embedded direct defintions would be really nice. Also I'd appreciate the small question section (with answers) google has. There generally need to be more features that give information about the query before clicking on any link. People want to use their search engine as fast as possible. The browser-app in general is nicely done and practical."
135427,"search results are often completely wrong/bizarre so of little use to me. Ive now been told that google now own this browser,some under counter deal done. Explains why it doesnt stop google tracking you,and why its started to get "clunky",often pausing for no reason.. Not whats it was originally intended to be thats for sure.. :( Ive also no idea why it keeps activating the camera but its well suspect imo.none of my other browsers does that. Sticky tape over cam lens haha.fkem."
135430,"I used to love it but now it's very annoying trying to scroll and instead refreshes it (losing sometimes text already typed). Once in a while freezes after a few attempts to access the tabs (and instead refreshing) and I can't scroll nor access tabs, it's very frustrating. Please allow users to disable it."
135435,"Love what you are doing security. 10 Search is not as good as babble I hope you know what I mean. In saying that I believe that they are attacking your search software and they keep trying to track my searches don't know why. I'm not that important."
135436,"Everything is good or I can say great in this app except there's no downloading page icon available and I am the person who download movies and songs etc everyday. So I am supposing that soon this feature will be available in this app like uc and opera browser then this app is going to be the best available until then I will keep it uninstalled."
135438,"Used to be very happy with 🦆 🦆 go. Some sites are browser broken so still have to use Chrome still in incognito but not many. Just this week mobile web Gmail has gone weird and duckduckgo forces a preview pane on a phone screen when there's no room for it! Chrome displays it correctly but duckduckgo has a 1/3 of the screen mashed up with an email preview."
135442,"Great browser that ended up breaking. Scrolling through facebook, twitter, and youtube causes the browser to flash black and white when a video begins playing. Scrolling through facebook or washington post causes browservto flash making the browser pretty useless. Gave it 3 stars though as im sure this is a temprorary bug and the browser worked fine before. For now, ill be switching overbto Firefox, hopefully duck devs fix the flashing issue soon before i end up staying with firefox."
135447,"New version not at all good. With latest update some websites like gmail opens in segment view. I. E. The highlighted mail opens in side. And we can't access it any way. We have to load in dektop version of site then only the mail can be viewed. This is after last update yesterday. Before that it was working fine. No other change."
135460,"I have been using Duck for many months now and it has been great but for the last couple of days the sites aren't loading, to be precise no sites are loading, it is not even letitng me search anything. I have got used to this app now and it would be helpful if you look into the matter Thanks"
135462,"It's a great app should you wish to browse without the hassles of ads. Only drwabackdrawback is that you can't go back to the previous tab. Either than that, it's proper"
135466,"Clean UI, and fast. Main complaint is results are sometimes completely off base. I will search something on web results, and then click on images and the results barely match up. (Safe search is off) Tested against chrome and Bing and they provide accurate results. Thought ddg used their results but it could be how they parse the data"
135475,"So far I like it. Seems clutter free. However an Exit choice in the menu would be nice. Update: has frozen a couple of times to the point I had to go into settings and do a force stop. Even swiping it to the right didn't close it."
135479,"I enjoy the feature of closing the tabs and clearing the history. I'd like this app better if it would clear cookies out at more frequent interval. I like thr new feature of letting me know when it blocked trackers. Some way to have bookmarks/ favorites would better very nice also."
135482,"The latest update ruined it. Websites keep getting stuck or load only partially. Clicking the 🔥 button does nothing and hangs the browser into a blank screen. I have to use the Android app switcher key or long press the home button to come out. Only restarting the phone fixes this after it happens. Please fix it."
135489,"Data security is a very big lie ! My browsing history and location history being used by Facebook even after browsing only through this browser. Keyboard wont appear automatically for some websites unless we refresh the page. Videos in webpage feed goes blank for few seconds...i dont know why ! Hope bugs would be fixed in nxt update."
135493,"Do not use this app or duckduckgo if you value your privacy. It sends data back to their US based servers and tracks your web history (you can check the discussions on the app's GitHub). The fact the app doesn't even give you the same amount of options to check what it's doing with your data is also alarming. This is not a privacy app."
135495,"After the recent update, whenever I search anything it always shows "Error: webpage not available". My internet connection is totally fine and chrome works perfectly well but I don't know what's wrong with duckduckgo. If this issue gets resolved, I am ready to rate it 5 stars."
135497,"Since I've been using DuckDuckGo, I have had more security breaches -- including exposure and subsequent spamming of my last private email address that I use to conduct business, received emails containing content involving a medical procedure I recently had (and I have ALWAYS kept my microphone disabled in ALL apps except my calling app), an attempted Twitter hack (I haven't logged in to Twitter in 5 years), and a stolen debit card number -- than I have ever had in my history of using the web."
135501,"It has gotten worse. The browser is following all other browsers. The settings you put in place are not saving, ads appear on every search as the first few links, and there is no help to fix the issues."
135502,"I was pleased with this browser at first, but for some reason, when I watch a youtube video or webm, it will start flashing colours and not move a single frame. Please fix this, or I might have to switch to a different one"
135503,"Well duck duck go doesn't offer what it promises. I have set it's setting to clear data on closing the app but when I reopen the app everything is there as I left it. And one more thing after I logout my any Id(fb, Twitter etcetera etcetera) though after reopening the app I see my account running like I never logged out. So there you have it."
135524,"Hate this appp. Most of the sites are broken in this browser. Also Desktop view is not working correctly. I log in a site with this app and the site is broken in this browser I tried to logout **** this app make me mad I can't logout also can't access through other browsers because I already logged in with this bloody app. Now I am mad this bloody app"
135538,"Apparently uses Chrome in the background, so not really private, and it lets censorship happen in websites, so again not private. UPDATE: And now it is completely bought into the Google and Facebook censorship with certain particular videos "glitching" and unwatchable while others, all particular ones, are fine."
135542,"The new update is garbage! Keep the old version as long as you can! There are certain searches/sites that now get an error message when you try to load them now... I know it isn't me, because my other browser has no problem accessing these...."
135548,"It's good to use. But I miss video forwarding and reversing feature using guestures. Like we should be able to forward the video by swiping the finger towards right and similarly swiping left should reverse it."
135552,"Edit: The app is completely nonfunctional when I'm using NordVPN...which is frustrating considering this browser is marketed to people who value security and privacy. My only complaint is that the spacebar on the keyboard is too small, and I constantly end up typing periods on accident."
135556,"Allow this app to be moved to SD card for android 7 nougat users. I would like Norton to protect this browser. I dont feel very comfortable searching as no indication if sites are safe to go to. Otherwise appreciate your privacy motivated app."
135560,"I love this browser. But the pull to refresh update, just ruined my experience. Even a slight pull would simply initiate the refresh, although I don't want it. Let me just pull!, then it can refresh!!!!"
135569,"Security and anti tracking features are what caught my eye but after using it for a while I noticed that region specific searches aren't very good! I live in Ireland and most results are from UK so it's not quite where I need it to be for usability."
135579,"It's ok but not great. Loading times can be slow or timeout. Also lately it keeps giving me the message that your offline atm but I know that's not the case. Like I said it acts weird....a lot!!!"
135582,"Was very happy with it for the first two days then somehow, my SD card got corrupted & I lost a lot of stuff! A lot. So as you can imagine I was less than happy. For the life of me I cannot figure out what went wrong. The only thing different that I had done was try this browser for a couple of days."
135585,"After filling out a long series of questions, I hit a website page error and had to go back. DDG did not just go back one link. It went back to its own home page losing all the progress I had already made, totally inacceptable. Uninstalling DDG permanently."
135589,"Will edit the ratings if I get a valid response I am unable to search for anything, can't visit sites, it'll just time out the connection. But if I turn on my VPN it'll fix it. I'm from India and I'm pretty sure this app isn't banned, any solution to this?"
135606,"This browser has been great until maybe the last update. Now, whenever I execute a search, it fails to load the search results and gives me a blank white screen until I use the button to sort of reload."
135611,"Love the unbiased and readily available information with no algorithms to shove propaganda in your face. But UI needs a little work. Just needs to be a little more user friendly. The little things you know?"
135617,"When I first saw the availability of a DuckDuckGo browser it seemed like a good thing. After all I prefer their search engine to google. But this thing has an annoying popup feature the only purpose for which seems to be to annoy me. Guess what - it works! I am annoyed. Uninstalling this pos. "You got this""
135627,"I love the app but lately I can barely get any page to load without refreshing it multiple times. Without the glitch it's a 5 star app, but the glitch is very frustrating."
135635,"VERY UNHAPPY,i just updated the app and once it was done ALL my "add to home screen"short cuts are GONE!I had schooling sites saved too and now its all gone!this is not ok I will be deleting, what is the point of privacy if i can't revisit sites that are saved to my phone."
135641,"Hi - two stars. No option to import or export bookmarks. No option to install add ons. The only good thing is the browser can be configured."
135654,"Downloading is a mess, files don't download correctly and no progress bar is showing, requiring you to hit the download link twice to confirm it was actually downloaded. Some files are literally 1% downloaded with no status update. It's killing my interest"
135665,"compare to chrome.. search results are more competitive in chrome... in privacy it's better than chrome... also less ads in the browser.. but it did a worst job in downloading.. it messed with song's name..."
135667,"Was good till latest update, you are on a website for a bit and as you scroll down deeper it suddenly fails with an error code and apology, back out and go back in and same thing happens again. Back to Chrome until this is resolved."
135668,"a few issues... #1 so if i use duck duck go browser, i cant really look up things near me accurately which sucks because then i jave to use chrome which makes it pointless. #2 sometimes the service is jist soooooo slow. i know it uses other engines but still... if its a browser it needs to step up."
135673,"Suffers from over zealous support for pull down refresh to the point where I've had to stop using it. EVERY time I pull down to look up the page, the thing reloads. How this got through testing I don't know."
135677,"Nice user experience, but with a few caveats: it appears to take ages to startup, and then seems to reload each tab after switching."
135685,"So, this app is a overall good, private browser that protects you. My problem, is that you can just download something like Cake ™ or Yandex™ and be protected while it's still going fast. That's it."
135687,"While I applaud DuckDuckGo's commitment to privacy, there many painfully stupid implementations of core features, and the actual search capability is not that great, so it winds up requiring a lot more work than Google. Be prepared for repeated hair tearing and face palms."
135710,"The App is great appart from when the screen decides to go black, twitchy and flashy. Its very annoying and cant see anything on the web page until i reload it. But the it does it again in 30 seconds."
135715,"All searches match google. Its google owned and their stealing your data. Fellow conservatives stay faraway from this app and their search engine. Yahoo and bing give better results unlike this trash. Also app never opens websites correctly and downloads all attachments as .bin COMPLETE TRASH."
135725,"Great Web Browser, but recent update spoilt it! 😔 Do not like the square tabs, can't read titles / Web address properly. Please change back to the full width of screen or at least let us chose..... Shame because was just about perfect be."
135750,"It is quite fast, but it totally hides & blocks interactive text boxes on websites(forms). It is impossible to read talkbacks on legit news websited. It does that even on sites pre-defined as unproteded."
135767,"Might be the worst browser I've ever used. Seems tailor made to make you watch as many ads as possible, with no way to stop or even slow them down. An absolute nightmare. Strongly do not recommend!"
135770,"1.Guys you have to work on add blocker you have to make it more powerfull.. And i think you can make it... And the second one is whenever i am visiting on a website like movies site it's opening a new add tab and when i press the back button i jumped on the homepage... Please fix it as soon as possible...."
135776,"Can't search anything in this browser. Everytime I search for something it says web page not available 😒.Also My internet is working very fine.I even tried to reinstall it. It's just this browser that's not working."
135814,"Losing lots of tabs and then not finding the contents again. No history. Not great tbh. Works fine to browse until you want it to be a browser some manner beyond viewing."
135815,"I keep refreshing pages by accident. I don't know why the refreshing code was changed, but please add a toggle option to revert it to how it was before."
135816,"need to work on, while switching tabs, it opens the list from top, which kinda unconvenient. Do it simpler to switch in between tabs like chrome do, just by sliding the screen(url area). otherwise your app is good."
135825,"Been brilliant until update yesterday, now just freezes and won't load anything, not even search engine 🙁 Very frustrating! This is before and after doing today's security patch on Google Pixel 3a."
135845,"It works great. Just a small request. While surfing YouTube or other streaming sites to watch videos the player the video works in potrait mode. You should fix it to landscape options b"
135846,"Thanks. I love the new features introduced in this version. I really looking forward to see more advanced features in duckduckgo as chrome has."
135849,"Sorry, want to give it five stars. But I can't use my microphone and I refuse to enter text by hand. I use Duck DuckGo with Firefox and it works great. But this app is a no-go."
135882,"No navigation buttons. Too many websites simply refresh the page when clicking the return, leaving you permanently on a site with zero option to back out. This browser only has one direction, forward."
135898,"Gets 5 stars with a basic, and long overdue import bookmark file...until then, 3 stars it is. Complacency by the developers on such an easy and very requested feature."
135914,"Changes my swiftkey keyboard from black to gray and makes the long press characters unreadable. NO other app has ever shown this behavior. Unusable for me so deleted and chose Brave instead"
135915,"Love the app except for when the page is loading in dark mode. Please improve the page loading so that it loads in black instead of white during the dark mode. I'll leave 3 stars for now until it is fixed."
135922,"## No response to my question? An app proclaiming to protect Privacy should not start unless the user has started it.## #What is wrong with updating the list of trackers when the USER starts the app? # why do you have the run at startup permission??"
135923,"Just for not having the exit button/option. like what the brave browser have. Hopefully, dev will add the exit option in next update."
135927,"Recent version is not working at all, I had set it as default browser and after that it's not working at all. Always get 'connection timeout error'"
135933,"Good speed and my search history doesn't pop up as ads in my social media. The search results however, could use some work"
135938,"There should be an option for voice search as it saves a lot time and it is used more now a days.. Overall nice and great app"
135950,"I'd love to use this search engine but Google just has it nailed. Apple maps is awful compared to Google and duckduckgo just doesn't flow right. It's not as slick or as user friendly. Genuinely gutted."
135976,"I wish that you could clarify search options to look for results by site. Such as only getting results for a certain site based on what you put into the search bar."
135994,"It's a good basic information finder but I can't use it for many things including navigation because it doesn't do voice commands only typed. I feel safer browsing the web."
136018,"I reallly like duckduckgo for its privacy... but i really like to have my history recorded only in phone..and downloads tab also..its do frustrating to find my download going inside the file manager again and again"
136022,"Despite the problem of spam pages loading in front of the page opened it's a great search engine, that sorted I now have annoying messages that appear everytime I use Duckduck on the screen"
136025,"only one thing I dont like, cannot put in a home page, alwayws have to write search engine tags on browser box, like to see webpage instead of empty page saying duck duck duck duck duck duck freaking GO! Tired of it. Who's the genius that invented the name?"
136037,"I like this browser pretty well, but it absolutely needs an option to stop auto-loading/auto-playing videos."
136042,"+. Small & Good browser with nice speed and security. -. Taking permission to view and use media/photo gallery etc in exchange of this app."
136045,"The app is very useful but please fix when i press back button from other tab it closes the application rather than going back to first tab or homescreen, please fix it's very irritating."
136050,"I uninstalled the app after "the long awaited feature: push-to-refresh" update which can't be turned off. Maybe in a year or two..."
136060,"I really liked the privacy when I first downloaded this app, but since the most recent update, it does not load pages and I cannot get any pages to load."
136067,"duckduckgo is my favourite browser but sorry to say its not working properly these days. It doesn't search anything. Please fix this issue."
136073,"Can't see file download status. And browser doesn't support allfile types. Will be excellent if such basic issues are fixed"
136076,"buggy & unusable, cant watch videos in 2020, really? video in FB causes whole screen to flash black & white, beware if u have epilepsy!"
136127,"I like the old version tho. The new update is so slow on reloading page. But my connection is so good. Yeah Hello Chrome. Comeback? 🤣"
136135,"Some websites open with error and images distorted. Most expecially gmail account viewing. I would have upload the screeshot but there is no provision for it here."
136158,"Such a waste of time, my Samsung tablet frozed up when I tried to open it, worst case scenario is that it didn't do one bit to block any ads at all."
136193,"Long press to save images doesn't work 80% of the time. I want to keep using this browser but if I can't save images out if it, it's useless to me."
136198,"Seriously, fast and smooth browser..bro it's not opening the single site every time I try to open it shows webpage not available, totally frod app waste of time useless, it's garbage. If anyone is reading this plzz do not install"
136199,"This app was one of the best in the biz but after the last update even the pages are not loading. Please do fix the issue. I'm unable to use the app"
136207,"It still goes through Google to connect and it would not send a code to get Duck duck to connect. This a scam saying the won't track you like Google does it goes though Google to connect."
136214,"It keeps setting itself as the default browser when I've repeatedly reset it to Chrome. Please fix this. Its severely annoying and on the verge of an Uninstall."
136233,"The apps very good and usefulthe first time I searched it it was easy to find what I need but now it's getting kind of harder to find what I need but besides that the app's pretty useful"
136246,"This is not working on my phone. Initially it was. Everytime I open tge browser and search, it shows webpage not available."
136265,"Like it... But some connection problems came out recently... Had to uninstall as it would not work... Will reinstall it again once problem resolves..."

136280,"Was working fine till recently. How ever unable to browse anything after the update stating web page unavailable even though it is the default search engine."
136289,"Please fix the apps inability to play video links! It often goes black and then completely dead. Otherwise great app."
136291,"The one problem that I encounter is I want to be able to talk into the phone but you have it incognito mode all the time so you cannot do that That's very aggravating"
136296,"Loading speed is awfully slow & most of the time, it's not even loading at all. Moving on to the next reliable app."
136316,"Please make swipe-to-refresh a configurable setting. The app is almost unusable on my phone now since adding this feature. I loved this browser."
136321,"It was great and then suddenly sucks, it must be the updates, I can't even open/read my email on gmail without switching to the basic html format so have to uninstalled it"
136324,"Too many crashes. Hangs too much. Wont let me download. Either the app is compromised by hackers/government or its owned by google directly or indirectly. If you value privacy this app is a trap"
136334,"Too slow. Also when u go back a page, it takes u to a blank page and u have to type in your search again."
136350,"Gmail sucks. I have to rotate my screen the long way just to read my emails. It gives me a long text of letters when my phone is right side up."
136358,"Really great browser but lacks a lot of features wen it comes to ui and few other things, please improve the ui and u would win a 5⭐ from every user..."
136367,"ebay website barely works. a top website and only partial functions work? this makes no sense. and whats up with all the updates? i see no improvements update after update."

136445,"some sites i TRIED to visit were in another language... im used to thetranlator option Chrome has.... do you have that ability... if you do 5* are yours t. y."
136468,"No dark/night mode.. If pres back key , browser exit without asking Need multiple windows in list view It's better Setting menu placed in below.. currently it's in right top"
136480,"Good and easy to use it contain every thing in it. It is faster and speed answerig what you are in need of. Thanks"
136482,"The search engine is very slow. Also when I back out of a webpage the browser stays in the same tab instead of closing it"
136488,"Can't figure out how to make it into a search "bar" like Google. And when I hit the back page button it goes back to duckduckgo instead of the pervious pages"
136491,"The app is freezing & crashing on several websites. Doesn't happen with other browsers for the same websites! Pls address immediately or uninstalling duckduckgo!"

136547,"Why the search engine is not working ? Before downloading the new upate the app was working fine and after updating it's unable search anything."
136550,"A few too many small incompatibility problems for me to continue using. I've very reluctantly gone back to Chrome."
136557,"Hello still no downloads features, we download the same file repeatedly and we can't even have any notifications please check about this issue Thanks I appreciate"
136563,"The option to blacklist website and ads should be given. Ad's are a bit annoying. Give us an adblocker then this app is worth a 5 star."
136598,"The user experience could be improved. There are times when I can see a half loaded webpage having 404"
136606,"Some site are not opening. App not responding force close , fix the error of duckduckgo not responding."
136627,"news in market abou duck duck go that you Are keeping website details or domains we are visiting. We using duckduck go because we thought it is private. But if you steal data like other web site what willl be difference between this app and other."

I am a babyboomer, there are many peole of i come in contact with a somewhat the same issue, leaving us xluejws I wish i had heard of this company years ago, it is putting my mind at ease. I think you should advertize to free, to people my age unaware of these dangers! Thank you, S.D."
136978,"Disappointing experience. App is too slow. Other browsers like Opera mini, Puffin and UC are best for me"
136995,"once that was a great app..now either i burn the history whenever i go to twitter it remembers my login and password and i dont want that"
137019,"Was great until recently when annoying pop ups started appearing. One of the reasons I use DDG is to stop this. Pls turn them off."
137039,"Was fine but shows porn in image search even under strict settings just while looking up a pokemon. Can't have my kids seeing that. Taking this off all my devices and going back to data hoarding google"

137157,"Video search favors YouTube without following search criteria; seems like fraud. and this "search" app is bogus."
137173,"Apparently Google has hijacked your service by over loading my new phone with who knows what. Beta something so it just defaults to Google. So you probably won't get this ?"
137187,"Totaly waste app,nothing is there as told Too slow connection .sometimes not connecting even in good network"
137192,"It kept interrupting me with pop ups of its own and sites i usually only click i had to sign in to. Uninstalling"
137199,"Upgrade to be user reinsuraning point out differences between incognito browsing and vulnerable search engines"
137296,"Why everytime I try downloading an app get ready for open and it starts downloading again makes me think developer's software spying.Google get it together and get rid of this B.S"
137395,"Nice ap.. But why dont u have a download option at all ...u can't even see your download progress..... U need to fix this or i am uninstalling asap"
137441,"No adds sometimes depends if the duck is awake or not! Not as beneficial as it sounded. But can't complain."
137457,"It's cool, but the searches are very unhelpful especially when it relates to my country. I guess it's not suited for East Africa"
137458,"Thank you for the privacy but somehow spam still got through and found my phone number. I'm still not sure how."
137549,"Just tried it to see if it can block ads and it's completely useless. I dont recomand wasting your time with this"
137604,"From two days it is continuously showing Net::Err_name_not_resolved. Cant able tou use app totally. Reply?"
137693,"Love the app, the way it how works and how smooth it is, UI is clean but the only downside for me is that it consumes tons of my mobile data plan even if im just browsing for a few minutes. It happened after the recent update. All i usually do is read some few articles that's all. If it is a bug or something please help me out."
137701,"It is a worst browser, it says always negative thing about google it is not speed of google waste of tim"
137702,"It's good but you can improve it. 1. the back button must close de new tab and go to previous page. 2. The tool and address bar must be put at the bottom of the page to reach with one hand. 3. Give more buttons on the toolbar (where is the forward - you don't have to push another button to find it). 4. give me more privacy options. 5. give me an ad blocker. 6. The way you have all the pages opened is not good for one hand use."
137729,"Is no longer working for me. 1 more try then uninstall. DO NOT UPDATE THIS APP. IT WILL NO LONGER WORK!!!!!!"
137766,"Would prefer a home screen with a search field other than the address bar. I guess I'm a bit old school. I would prefer to keep the address bar visible at all times, but I can't find any option to allow that. Also, backing out of tabs doesn't work to go back to a previous screen. Instead, when backing out of a link opened in a new tab, I get the home screen on the new tab rather than the tab I left so I must individually close tabs."
137850,"Did love this app. But have since tested app with Panopticlick (which I trust - check it out) and find that protection against trackers is only partial. I am testing other browser apps and find others such as Brave and Firefox give full protection. Please explain. I will never trust 'claims again and will always test and suggest others do too. Now I will use duck duck go search engine only with Brave or Firefox = no trackers. All trackers must go, no exceptions."
137851,"I have not yet been able to apply this app to my needs. Now in theory I love the idea. So, if there could be a step by step instuction manual that could help me out, that would be good.6/19/2020 I love this app! I feel as if someone is looking out for me, not Biggie's Google. Facebook Cloud.... Etc, etc. I have told my friends about it, they'll be joining soon. Thank You, Cheryl Cady"
137859,"I search any thing he take many much time compair to another application and he take average 2 min to open any site"
137863,"There are certain pages/YT videos that seem to infere with this browser and wouldn't allow me to view them. There are times that this browser doesn't directly answer my queries, and sometimes give me irrelevant results. I seem to be able to search anything thru its search engine, but after using this for a while, there was a certain website that is blocked in this browser and would not let me view it."
137911,"Was surprisingly good at first besides a few missing features from chrome for Android. Ultimately what made me uninstall is that webpages just wouldn't load approximately 50% of the time. I wound up manually copying URLs into chrome or edge to get it to load instead. In the comparison to chrome, I missed the swipe down to bring up all tabs and swipe left or right to delete."
137928,"I like the privacy this browser offers, but one feature of this app is mildly annoying to infuriating. Hitting the 'back' button on my phone allows me to go a page back, but going past the original page typed in exits the app and I need to renavigate to the site all over again. I was just now filling out a form with many fields and lost all data because the app exited from hitting back one too many times. Chrome and Ghostery never did this and it's incredibly annoying."
137936,"Like having this option for a private search engine. NOT happy that Google is dominating our LIVES. Have found that going to another "search" requires I delete the page I'm on to start the search. Takes time to learn a new system and obviously Google has been our school for browsing. Will try hard to stick with this service!"
137952,"Used to be good. Now there is some cutesy popup in the browser that you can't turn off. I want to block popups, not have you put your own instead. Update: The popups seem to have finally stopped. Seems a bit sluggish on java heavy sites and occasionally crashes but otherwise works well enough."
137961,"just about good enough to use but has some usability issues.______ pro: good for privacy. as fast as others.______ cons: no forced zoom option for pages. it's sometimes difficult to scroll down a page without 'accidentally' clicking something. when scrolling down you often get a warp speed movement. if a link opens in a new tab then you click back it doesn't close that window and return you to the original tab. you can't highlight text in Facebook to copy"
137976,"I like how much private it is, but I don't like that is not saving my websites that I visited regularly - well I can add them to the bookmark list but is not very handy, also I need to log in to certain websites everytime I close the app even if I select an option such as "remember me". Overall, better than chrome."
137978,"I have tried for three months now, to get rid of the Gestyy-virus that your browser is allowing onto my phone. Your ad-blocker simply does not work and I find it a gross misrepresentation of what you are claiming your browser is capable of. But it is a lie. I am therefore uninstalling and disabling your browser."
137989,"It has one major problem It won't wait patiently on you Like a little child it wants to be helpful. At the wrong times but it's a winner the keeper and extremely useful and serves a good purpose even when its creeping.around an you Really need to uninstall it for a minute) cuz I'd rather have it then be without my 🤗 seven-year-old creep 😝😋🥰 he really does mean well🤗. (This coming from me Is saying a lot I hate to share ! TerryC"
138023,"Eats up far too much RAM for a no-frills mobile browser and likely has memory leaks as no browser app should be using nearly 50 memory (1.7+ GB) max use with just one tab open, leading to website navigation breaks and could lead to privacy/security issues. Not multitasking friendly. Needs a lot of work still but each update over several months doesn't improve it."
138077,"A great browser, however one flaw. Whilst the browser supports a dark theme, this does not work on actual websites, unlike many other browsers. So whilst you have a nice dark themed browser, you'll still be seeing websites with their blinding and battery draining white/light themes. Fix this issue and the rating will be higher!"
138083,"This app is very good and best but 1 problem if i download something i don't stop or pause this downloading. So please solve this problem or bug in your system hurry. .......by the way i am from india. And 1 more problem if i download something from your browser so those file is not moved in my memory"
138098,"Like the app, but it needs maps, etc. If I'm giving up the notoriously leftist Google, I don't want to press "directions" on Duck and it automatically go to Google Maps. Needs work guys! Let's be TOTALLY independent of Google! I know you'll get there in time. I'm already telling friends to "Duck it!""
138101,"Great because I'm not getting any new ads on Facebook and other social media platforms.. Not great because it isn't the easiest browser to navigate.. That said I would recommend it to others looking for a browser that will help them eliminate unwanted ads"
138129,"I just started to use this browser, so I will update this review later, I left it at 3 stars for neutral for now"
138158,"It doesn't give immediate or direct web page surfing like google the search engines seems like google pulls more direct content related to your search where as duck go is still limited....it might just be me.but for the comfort of not being tracked I'll take it! Thanks HOWARD!!!!!LOL"
138177,"Sorry but when i downloading image in duck duck go it cant it dont want let download the image and when i go to google ehen i download the image its not showing in my gallery and it says image bin and when i click it it just no search app or installed.this is very dissapointing"
138179,"I have tried to go further into something and couldnt and i have trued to look up things onky to get suggestions thst werent even close. Thank you."
138180,"As much as i like duckduckgo it worries me that google was historically against them and now google will update them, just doesnt feel right.."
138206,"My biggest problem is the lack of a back button on the browser this would be a great assistance in moving through a website. Otherwise I find the browser good and the fewer people with my browsing info the better."
138207,"Overall satisfactory but a couple problems. My biggest problem is search results usually don't have visible issue dates for the link information. Annoying when you're looking for current information. Even including dates in the search bar brings up old information."
138220,"I feel more confident with my privacy, great search engine! I've only been using DDG for my primary browser for less than a week, and at this point, the only thing I miss that other browsers have is the ability to enlarge what I'm viewing with my 2 fingers."
138249,"the mobile phone version ensures privacy. Laptop/PC Version of Chrome extension does not do so and shows all links. I have installed in another phone but all suggestions /complaints of missing Search box and widget have got no response."
138253,"Love the idea. Deviating from the concept of tabs is horribly obnoxious. Be private. Don't re-invent anything. Netscape is dead but I'd take it over this app."
138261,"Consistently FAILS to download files, can not name the files downloaded, can not choose into which sub-folder files are downloaded, can not search for images by image, consistently receiving error messages upon clicking links, webpages refusing to x-out when clicked appropriately, can not import/export bookmarks to/from other browsers, extremely user-unfriendly with an excruciatingly buggy UI. And I've had this app for less than a day! `Eff` this trash! Uninstalled!"
138263,"Why is this sending me notifications when background data is turned off. How is it fetching this info if it's set to BG data off in SYSTEM SETTINGS for this app? Privacy my axx. Haven't used this app in 3 days, yet there it is, just like every other stupid app in Google Play. You developers are all the same... It's all $$$."
138321,"It's good for what it does and within its intentions, however after using it some time there's a few things that annoy me about it. The first one it the way it just takes you right back out of the search randomly when you press the back button. Say you go on images and press back sometimes it will take you back to the previous page, but others is takes you out completely and you have to type into the sesrch again. Also the keyboard changes layout when you open the app."
138338,"Mid range vote as I'm new to it, depending on its behavior in the coming weeks and months I might change it. So far, so good though!! 👍"
138342,"It works fine as a web browser, but you sometimes miss the search ability of google when using this, the part you've replaced. It is so much better to search for places around you, movie theaters times, weather, and specific information on google (to name a handful). For example, if you googled sunset it would give you the answer right there, but with this you go into search results to find the answer. So I guess what I'm saying is that you are compromising for track-free web browsing."
138345,"It's really fast, but I miss a couple of features. Pinning the menu bar on the bottom instead of the top, leaving the address bar at the top. Switching between tabs by swiping the address bar to the left or right. Quick button for bookmarking website's. Already used DDG as default search engine for years, so going to give this browser a try for the upcoming days/weeks. Also, open new tabs in the background. A quick button to open the startpage. A startpage with buttons to most visited pages."
138358,"This browser is really good for performance, speed and lightweight design. The only issue with it is desktop site feature is inconsistent. Sometimes it works fine but most of the websites it doesn't and most of means 2/10 websites loads successfully in desktop, rest remains in mobile view only. Hopefully it will be fixed and i hope duckduckgo will remain my default browser in future too."
138360,"I use it pretty much always, but it seems they intentionally remain generic quality. duckduckgo was getting better than Google, and then they got worse again. I have a theory. They're either using search algorithm writers that intentionally provide inferior algorithms, or they've got a deal with Google to retain an inferior search quality. There is a better. Google used to be it. If you learned how to put keywords correctly, and you were willing to look through it, you could find anything."
138372,"If you could get rid of the tracking and monitoring of location the app would be great. Only people of faith and good morals should write apps."
138381,"One ,there is no way to disable it,uninstall is the only option. Two, when i try to switch back to Chrome ,this browser takes over. Until you get this fixed,with an option to disable..... i'm going to have to uninstall."
138404,"Good browser but if you have 75 -100 or more favorites / bookmarks in different categories it is too time consuming to scroll through the list. It's just a mass of disorganization. You might as well retype your search in the browser. It can be faster than scrolling the list. It's the only thing that turned me to another browser otherwise it would be my main choice. Can't compromise on this matter. Great otherwise."
138406,"I like the privacy, but it's function needs work. If I search for pictures, then click on one, then back, then click another, then back, etc, for some reason it seems to create a chain. If I wish you go back to the original search by hitting the back button, it will take be through the ENTIRE chain of pictures I clicked on. Normal browsers would essentially reset the chain if I looked at a picture and then hit back, so I wouldn't have to hit the back button a hundred times."
138418,"Decent browser, until you realize you can't export bookmarks or tabs. They also seem not to care about it, idk why this would be so difficult since they have to be stored in a file somewhere. The user can't access the data folder, and they even don't tell you where it is. Maybe it works manually if the phone is rooted. So yeah, don't collect bookmarks with this browser."
138435,"Ads were blocked, everything was cleared on exit; it seemed like I had found the perfect app to use and keep my searches private. But after a few months I started getting scam pop-ups. At first I dismissed it but now it has become a recurring issue and I can't seem to do any of my work without being instantly opened to another tab so someone can scam me. I'm very disappointed, this app had so much potential."
138444,"Ehh, it's fine I guess. Not the mega ass legend but it's ok enough. Sucks that it doesn't carry other valid websites, that's my most biggest criticism. Other than that, yeah, it's just a search engine that can allegedly block out El Creepos Google."
138447,"It's ok, but still need work on back function. Takes you to beginning rather than the previous screen at times. Slower than some, but the blocking features are nice."
138467,"A couple of things that I don't like.. when I click a link a new tab opens which is fine but when I'm done with said tab and press back it minimises the app. Instead you have to close the tab and then choose your previous one. Can pressing back just take you to the last tab?? Secondly, I'm in the UK and search results are never local. Presumably US related results. Other than that it's all OK."
138470,"Annoying that it seems obsessed with opening new tabs every time you click on a bookmark. Would be good to turn that off in the options. Also refresh by swiping down would be handy. Doesn't handle pdfs, "could not open file" error message"
138476,"its pleasant in a way that doesnt come off as creepy like big corporations do and also makes me feel safe and cool when i use it. my only problem is how small picture thumbnails are. on google its easy to see, but on duckduckgo thumbnails are so wide i feel like im peering through a backyard fence squinting and trying to figure out what im looking at."
138493,"Usage experience of this application is good so far. I have one suggestion though. When a PDF file is to be downloaded, it opens up in a new tab and that tab remains open. The developer may consider that when the link to any PDF file is tapped, then it doesn't open in a new tab but in an already existing tab, like it so happens in other brousers. Also a quick toggle gesture to switch between the tabs may also be considered."
138494,"I would like bookmarks toolbar please. Also extension add-on ability like ublock, Facebook container alike but maybe better? Other than that information, and options on blocking tracking, and cookies. This app has good potential but needs those few things to be. This browser has good potential, but unfortunately i cannot use it as main, because of these things."
138497,"Very bad, actually! Before and after updating, it's misleading to the first search, and canceling the previous. The app does not respond. It's a shame. It used to be quick as a ray and fast. Now is one more waste of time."
138513,"Where in the Hell is your Downloads Path? Why must i see an Anoyying duck every 5 mins? Why does everything i download end up unsuccessful, when other browsers have no issues with downloading? Why should i Use your Tedious UI? Where are any of the main, basic features a Web browser should have when even F***ing Opera has them?! All this Browser is good for, is a 6/10 Add block, and Security that even Mozzila has. Screw this. Uninstalled, almost after 30 mins in using it."
138541,"Browser is good but why can't I edit the settings and make it so that every link opens in the same window instead of opening a new one every time? It gets tedious rather fast."
138543,"..the more users use it the refinement improves..takes a bit of getting used to but it's a principle I like; I'm seeing on my mobile how by stealth subliminal the internet passes messages and control duckduckgo may well be my go to once i am rid of mobile contracts; I'm so disgusted with the news the plagiarism voyeurism on mobiles to have something in media I can in someway control who knows what about me the better"
138544,"With every recent update this has just become worse and worse. It's now SO slow to load pages. It's at the point now where it's unusable. Been using DDG for years, sadly now though I must find an alternative."
138550,"Its streamlined and functions well, i feel safe and fancy free to browse :D I would give 5 stars but there aren't any options to print webpages or add helpful extensions, like to read webpages better or offline. It has to be my secondary browser bc of that, when i want it to be my primary. Its a bit slow too, but for what the browser does, it seems fast compared to something similar. Overall its a good browser for what it does and takes up next to no space on my phone :)"
138557,"I really want to love this browser but it's soooo slow. It means that I have to then use other browsers that I'm trying to avoid. Also I appreciate the incognito element but I would like to be able to copy and repaste into search bar, but have to always type in. Can there be a setting that allows you to copy/paste, at least during any session where you're continually active? Please help me to get the most out of this app as I really want to make it my main browser"
138566,"Changing my review form 5 stars to 2. I did really love this app but after the last update they moved everything to the top, and got rid of bookmarks quick access. Dont like i have fo reach all the way to the top, or the ekstra press to show bookmarks."
138572,"Still a good app but recent updates have me searching for another. Several updates ago changed opened tabs to tiles. More recently, opening images, links that open in new tab/windows and downloads open a tab that you have to manually close and then navigate back to the "active" tab. That's just annoying. Pressing back repeatedly use to close the "active" tab, then the app. Now, if you open multiple external links from email and then press back to the email, you end up with a bunch of open tabs."
138577,"Some basic things are missing - can't even share images. Downloaded images don't show in any folder. Extremely irritating browsing behaviour. Often when browsing within a site, clicking a link will open a new tab without obvious notification. When you try to navigate back, the tab just goes blank (surprising you, because you didn't know it opened a new tab) and you have to view all tabs to find the original site."
138578,"It's not bad. But needs a lot of work on it. I know they can improve on it as time goes on. I hope the next update will help us to hide our identity and were we are from because most of the website were able to locate my country and that is WRONG! I noticed that "some" adverts were able to bypass the security the app provide. But in all I think it's good."
138589,"Locks up a LOT, requiring close/reopen, oft repeatedly, apparently if it finds anything on a page it does not "like". May not ever open some pages other browsers handle just fine. Cannot save pages, pics, vids, or even highlight and save text from pages, in most cases. This reduced functionality supposedly needed to increase browser security? Not sure how much more secure it is, but it is barely a browser, in many ways."
138593,"Edit: Amened my review after checking results from panopticlick and others. Browser does have a unique fingerprint. And blocks only as many trackers as possible without breaking most websites. Some tracking is still possible. If it fits your needs use it. But it is a middle of the road solution. Much better than what most mainstream browsers offer out-of-the-box without add-on customization. Review is 1-star because the browser is marketed as private. Regarding funtionality it is quite good."
138619,"4.22.20. New update is no help. Here's a work around for the app's incompetence: When a web page hangs up (not if, when...) close all tabs and exit the browser. Restart. ...and in the 10 or 20 minutes since the first review DDG has crashed once, required a restart, and then took 30-60 seconds to load a simple web page. On my Samsung S10. You're headed quickly to a one star review and an uninstall, ducky. Really fast, as in about 24 hours if that can even be tolerated. Horrible browser."
138632,"The browser itself is great and easy to use. I've even switched to DuckDuckGo for my desktop search needs. It took a couple of weeks for me to realise why Google is the best. They have top notch SEO (search engine optimisation), and in this browser I rarely found what I was looking for through just typing it in the search bar. I had to go through Google. It would be nice if this browser had the option to set a default search engine but I see how that is unlikely."
138638,"I love the privacy, but the restriction defeats the purpose. The main reason why I installed a privacy-based browser was to, and I will shamelessly admit, browse NSFW pages. Now, so far it's been great. But when I search for "Adult" content, I can never see NSFW results in the other tabs besides "All", like "Images" and "Videos". Still a big problem as that's where I get most of my material. :/ Please fix this, or at least, show NSFW images and videos properly."
138639,"Well, thanks a lot. After a few months of use, I took the plunge and made this my default browser. Next, I spent far too much time creating shortcuts for the crucial sites to which I need quick and regular access. I downloaded the latest update and it erased all of those shortcuts. What a cool feature!"
138641,"I downloaded DuckDuckGo on all of my Android devices, and I'm quite enjoying it so far. I feel a lot more secure nowing that DuckDucGo blocks trackers and deletes my browsing history when I close the app. It is very fast, straight forward to use, and very accessible with the TalkBack screenreader for blind and visually impaired users. However, I'm only able to give it 3 stars as it's missing a very important feature - the ability to synchronize bookmarks across multiple devices. Please include!"
138642,"I love this app but for the past couple of months it freezes several times every day. All tabs freeze and it won't let me open anything in new tabs. I have to completely close the app and start over. I've done a system update and app update, and the problem still continues. Also the back button rarely takes you back to the last page and only opens a blank page. Pinterest links to open in browser no longer open in DuckDuckGo and redirect to a blank page."
138644,"DuckDuckGo randomly closes all my tabs. I can be reading a few pages, go to answer a WhatsApp message, and then all my tabs are gone, and all wiped off history. Outweighs any privacy advantages it might have had."
138654,"The address bar should either hide automatically after loading page or be fixed and not hide at all. Otherwise I can't see web page bottom bar which is sticked to the bottom of the page. It's super annoying. Especially when I use a web app, which has there an important feature like responding to a message contained in a bottom bar. In this case the element is "displayed" outside of the screen until I scroll up. It happens even if the page would fit perfectly in other browser without scrolling."
138655,"Seems okish. Hard to tell how private it really is, but seems to be better than Google or Samsung browsers in that regard. It loses 2 points, though, for not having a print feature. If I am trying to print or save files to PDF I have to go reactivate and use the non-private browser.. which largely defeats the entire point of having this app in the first place.. So I am considering uninstalling since I have to keep using the othes anyway. Plus the app is REALLY glitchy. Constantly crashing tabs."
138669,"So far, it seems to be okay though it has no add-on's. I want an ad blocker to use for YouTube because I'm fed up with all the commercials/ads!!"
138670,"Feeling really frustrated using this browser on my new Chromebook (I used DDG on my old Win10 system without a problem). Among other things, it seems to completely lack the right-click context menu e.g. I use 'open in new tab' extensively, and I'm really missing it. FWIW, Chrome on this new Chromebook does have the context menu."
138692,"My gripes: The new tabs page does not work well on a small screen, and with a slow processor. The creation of the thumbnails takes time, and the 'x' for deleting the tab is way too hard to hit with a normal finger. When returning to a page from the tabs page, the keyboard is often activated. *Very* irritating!"
138715,"Everything about this app is great but one thing that bothers me is when we press back button it goes to home menu or leave the app instead of going back to previous web page."
138717,"Where is the option to show download progress? This app is not user friendly. Switching between the tabs and reloading the page is a pain in the ass and frustrating. Page loading speed is good. The only reason I use this app is, it provides private browsing. So 3 stars!"
138720,"Major issues with using Youtube. I had to exit the page and open a new page every time I wanted to search something on Youtube. Eventually got tired of it and downloaded a new browser."
138727,"Amazing! Small app that runs smoothly. It's simple and convenient. There is one thing though. I can't download anything from the browser. Everything that I download is converted into a .bin file and my phone is unable to open it. I would appreciate if someone helped, since there aren't any solutions anywhere on the internet"
138758,"I love DuckDuckGo as a search engine. And set it as the default for my other browsers. I wish the Browser offered quite a bit more honestly... I've been testing a bunch of browsers to see which i like best. Edge and Bing have the rewards points which are cool. Then Osiris and Opera have amazing custimazation. Then I feel like Firefox, Epic and Startpage have Privacy tools rhat actually surpass DuckDuckGo browser... again i have DuckDuckGo set and the search engine for the other browsers"
138759,"Since the browser has messed up the autofill saves, how does one delete them and start again ? One thing that definitely needs to change is when one opens a link on one page, and a new tab opens to view the new page, when the back button is pressed the just opened tab should *NOT* just remain at the default view but should close and return the user to the tab where the link was pressed. Having to tidy up from this *every single time* is beyond all reason."
138774,"I would give this app 5 stars but just after Samsung did a firmware update I have not been able to download any types of images. I do not know if it is a compatibility issue. I had to do a master reset to my phone for it to work and then it will work for a couple of days then stop again. My phone company replaced the phone after the third time I called them about it and it is still doing it on the new phone. I really like DDG and use it on all my computers. Please look into this."
138789,"New self promotional jargon is annoying at best, completely unnecessary. This also interferes with other links. Example: when attempting to reach a link from Emails to eBay Duck Duck Go interferes with these new "at a boy" promotions. I've gone back to Google... Prior to this unwanted congratulatory verbage, I use DuckDuckGo exclusively as my search engine. Robert Luciano"
138795,"Works well when it works. Recent update (probably last two weeks) has caused intermittent crashes of the application when opening in-window options on webpages. Easy to replicate on any shopping site: the site will freeze and no other tabs will load past the halfway point. Only fix is to burn tabs and restart the whole app. Not currently usable."
138796,"Everything looked fine since I got the pop-up message: "Enjoying Duckduckgo?" And now it doesnt work anymore, its stuck at that point. Maybe it happens when there is an update? It happened again, and now after updating the problem looks solved."
138797,"Do you need to update your super slow app. I think so. You went from 5 stars to 3 stars. Update and maybe I will up it to 5 stars again, but not until you update."
138798,"This is not a good app. The search results are horrible and do not compare to Google's search results. Also, hitting the "back" button closes the app instead of bringing you back to the previous page. The UI is ugly, and there is no refresh button. Not much effort put into this at all. Inconvenient and clunky."
138809,"DDG is saving "filter by region" selection during search. There is no option or settings for this. It just saves! Even after the application is exit and apparently DDG says everything is cleared, how/where is this saved? Claiming to not track and then tracking is even WORSE than Google! Looks like DDG is not very different. I don't think I can trust DDG any more."
138810,"The interface is very slow. And if this app does not store data then why in the settings when I see this app's storage then it shows that there is some data stored. Apart from that in other search engines we can view the previously viewed tabs(if we have not removed them) but in this one is not able to do the same. Please resolve this issue otherwise I will be forced to uninstall this app"
138811,"Basically quite a nice browser, with some good features to protect one's privacy. However: * The concept of feedback categories as (positive / negative) and the practice to avoid negative feedback on the playstore by only redirecting positive feedback there are very dishonest * for some websites it might necessary to permanently store cookies / web storage /etc., e.g. to stay logged in. It would be great, if websites could be excluded from reset * A password manager would be nice"
138814,"I really want to use this browser. Unfortunately it is unusable due to the absence of forward or back buttons while browsing. Super useful and well designed mobile browser otherwise. Lack of this feature is like using a car with no reverse gear or a bicycle with no seat."
138832,"It's really good But there's one problem. Everytime i open a new tab. To read a recipe or something else. And when i close the tab and want to go back to the page i was on before it goes white and don't do anything. And it takes several minutes and when i have pressed back several times it goes back to start"
138836,"Works fine. Dont like the search bar being loaded with an ad. But other than that it is good. Would like to know more about how to go adless"
138839,"It's great but when i'm surfing in a certain website and want to go just to the previews page where i was the browser takes me to a blank page or to a new tab, i don't understand that, it's annoying"
138842,"All in all it's a good app and going to get better it could use a few more short cuts and livened up a little and a few more things to keep the interest going.but it seems to be going in the right direction.just don't get so big you loose yourself and what you originally set out to do."
138844,"Back doesnt work... If u press back to go to previous web page. Instead... It opens a new blank tab. Extremley annoying. Worked fine a few months ago. I habe tested this now on 2 totally different android phones. Same issue. Now the browser is basically useless. Emailed support twice about it and nobody bothers to reply."
138845,"Editing my former 5-star rating I initially wrote after 4 months of use. It's been a few more months and I now constantly go back to google chrome, though I don't want to. The ONLY reason I tend to use chrome is because swipe texting + auto complete are unusable in DuckDuckGo's search bar. In Chrome, spaces are auto inserted after words, but that doesn't happen in this app, making searching very hard. If this is fixed, I believe I can finally quit google, and will restore my 5/5 review."
138848,"Adequate browser, great tracking blocker, but....the tool bar is at the bottom and not movable. Very annoying. Should be at the top. Also, descriptions...totally lacking. There's a flame icon on the toolbar-what does it do? To scared to press....lol. Overall, no major issues. 5 stars...after some minor tweaks."
138889,"It's a nice browser. I like the rating you give to each website. However the user experience is not the greatest. I need to click two times to refresh the page and also click two times to change tab. If you could have the drag image to refresh like chrome and the changing tab like in opera you will get a lot more users"
138898,"I like the privacy aspect and the animated duck which appears with a message warning when anomalies or privacy threatening activities are detected. still assessing the experience though."
138901,"Very disappointed. I've been happily using the browser for a few months when today my browser icon disappeared from my phone. I tried in vain to create another one. I was forced to uninstall and then reinstall the browser app. I have lost all of my bookmarks! I'm very upset by this. I've also noticed changes in the browser so I'm wondering if this happened due to an update?"
138902,"Slightly slower but i have no problem with a lil less speed vs more privacy, why did the search bar stop showing what sites were trying to track me and you stopping them I actually like seeing what noisey trackers were being stopped! Revision: it would appear you aren't as forthcoming as I was led to believe and I have had to stop using your browser"
138921,"It recently began blocking my ability to load comments on some but not all sites. The error given is "We detected some connectivity issues, therefore, we’re unable to load Conversation". Other than this issue, it is or was my preferred browser. Please fix."
138926,"Good to have at least one browser that is privacy oriented. However following features are required for better experience: Videos should not auto-play; Gesture to navigate between open tabs; Ability to open a new website from bookmarks in an existing tab (currently opens a new tab); Tabs opened in background should load the links automatically; Loading a site on an empty tab via bookmarks & then pressing back just closes the browser instead of going back to the empty tab"
138936,"I've been using duck duck go as my primary mobile browser for the past few weeks and have really enjoyed it. Despite this, one feature that I feel is missing is the ability to make folders for bookmarks, it would have helped so much in keeping things organized."
138937,"Still no text only mode/simple mode and the bottom tool bar cant be reverted back to the traditional layout.... I mean the mapping is just not logical. After the update it kept lagging when scrolling(frequently lags). Re-installed this for the 4th time now and lagging persists, did a reboot too and cleared data/storage and cache lot of times It's not my phone's problem cause brave browser doesn't lag and that browser requires more juice to run. *Update: UI and UX sucks now. Using Via now"
138941,"When you search for something, it pulls up a bunch of other sites that has nothing to do with what your searching for....I want to see pics, options, and other links that I can click on. You don't want us to use Google because of privacy issues so you make your browser sound like a good option. Well here is an idea, make it more like Google with options, pics, etc and we would stray away from Google!"
138958,"Ooh. Adware. My daughter tried to warn me. I would turn notifications off. For your app. But. I haven't had to do that. For any other mobile browser. Ever. "We've got you covered. You've got this. You can browse safely" or some crop like that. Other dopier messages. I don't like pointless notifications. Don't need em. Your browser isn't tor anyway. Quite useless. Uninstalling. Microseconds. After posting this. You are immature dimwits. Cheers."
138960,"Please, instead of forcing this compromised browsing experience, simply make it a search engine, with an alternative widget to that of the scroogle search bar. That way, it shows results in it and when I tap a link, it just opens in my favorite and most feature packed web browser; Samsung Internet. I just want quick access to the DuckDuckGo search engine via a widget on my home screen, not for it to compromise my browsing experience. Better yet, make a separate app for that. Thanks."
138971,"These past updates r EXACTLY what we DON'T need! Why add "fireproof" list, sites change constantly. These are STILL no... "open in same/new tab" option, homepage, quick way to close tabs, static address bar, bookmark organization or folders. You have stupid icon colors as an option, but not the stuff above. You also added an annoying animation to the address bar, which completely blocks out the site name until its done playing. Still using firefox until you get with the times. F**king A guys!"
138972,"Its sad to see that a company that follows ethical and moral standards, has such a poor performance with respect to their apps. There are so many bugs that are quite irritating and frustrating to deal with, especially for the mobile browser. Personally, I didn't have any issues with the web browser. But the search hits are not what I aim for, and unfortunately, have to look towards the company's main rivals in the market (Google, to be exact). Please improve your search query hits as well!"
138989,"Improved URL animation? An update? Prior: DDG is great and all, but do not make it intrusive. I never ASKED for my "privacy report" from DDG. If I had wanted it, I would have opted in for that. But - It's NOT AN OPTION, *and* there's no place to TURN IT OFF. We get pushed notifications all the time - we don't want them. It's invasive to get things pushed on you. Please remove this "feature", or make it optional, with OPT-IN being a requirement."
138993,"The browser is buggy when browsing through images and makes the entire experiance broken. You are forced to view the image upclose without any option to reduce image size and stay in one spot of the image. You can't view the entire image as a whole. Terrible Browser, seen better designs elsewhere."
139001,"I like the idea of a privacy browser, but i find it's not as fluid as Google. At times links on websites don't load, or the transition to a different site is not smooth or it stalls. Also if trying to print something from my phone or save it as a pdf, that option is not available."
139003,"(No) thanks DDG for a pop-up after a few days ("Enjoying DuckDuckGo? We'd love to know what you think. A: It needs work/ I Iike it"). This TOTALLY FREEZES THE APP AND MY ENTIRE PHONE, can't be cancelled & reappears every time I open the app! Is it meant to link to G-Play to write a review?. I can't do ANYTHING on my phone for ~30s until Android rescues me with "DuckDuckGo? isn't responding: do you wish to close it?" So the app is now UNUSABLE! That's quite an achievement! Not good at all guys…"
139004,"Don't update!!!! Was a really great app.... The update wiped out all my links on the home page! I had several dozen, will take some time to replace, I will use the Chrome app instead, it has never wiped out favorites saved on the home page. You guys blew it."
139060,"Works well. The notification that appears when you start the browser about "You've got this! Every time you browse with me a creepy ad loses its wings" is really annoying and patronizing. Please get rid of it. I'm kind of embarrassed for the person who thought that was a good idea."
139072,"If it's replacing Google, it needs to diversify and update search results. So far, Duck's showing negative press by tabloids mainly and not the rest i.e. Prince Harry and Meghan. Duchess of Sussex"
139075,"The app and privacy it offers is great. I am not a fan of the closing out apps moved to the top instead of the bottom of the screen as previously."
139105,"first time in different as to how the app looks. Second I'm disappointed that the app kills the microphone on the keyboard so that I cannot talk and text. Make the microphone on the keyboard available with the app. Then maybe I'll use the app again."
139123,"I love the app it doesn't save the tabs for too long so it doesn't have a pileup of old tabs Will be five-star when the bottom 2 is added •Please just add a single more layer to the bookmarks free tip here you can call it shelves •make it stop instantly closing the tabs on moto"
139127,"The browser is very outdated and doesn't block ads. When an ad opens a new tab with a click, its hard to get back to previous tab i was browsing. Instead of bringing back to the previous tab. This browser closes the application and exits to home screen. This irritates a lot. Uninstalling.."
139131,"Browser is fine. Reasonably fast have not had a crash yet. Biggest problem is when on a page, hitting the back button to go back to a previous page, instead the browser always goes to the home page. Super annoying, and I use this browser less and less."
139132,"I like that it stops the other sites from tracking my activity. It does need a little compatibility work with some apps such as Spruce which my Naturopath doctor's office uses for purchases"
139135,"1st: if DuckDuckGo doesn't save data, why is there 23MB saved in app storage after I have been online, and more added each time I use it. I can understand cache data, but this is not cache. 2nd: since the last update which I did not down load, the icon for this app is gone so now it doesn't open at all. If I am being forced to update this app in order to use it, it is time for uninstall. I just updated to see if it would work.Still no icon, still won't open still uninstalling"
139142,"Lots of bugs, not as smooth and powerful as other browsers eg. I use Google search engine as their search engine doesn't work most of the time."
139147,"• I live in New Mexico and "find a store near me" puts me in N. LV, NV • Incognito mode will not allow voice to type mode- must hand type when using research bar • No instructions on how to turn incognito mode on and off • Love not getting ads popping up from an inquiry made 1 time by my son 3 years ago"
139150,"Literally no option to turn off autoplay on site videos, which are, besides privacy violations, the most annoying issue with websites. Find another browser until DuckDuckGo implements the basic ability to block autoplay by default. And no way to turn off JavaScript. Both these flaws make this browser all but useless."
139157,"This app doesn't block trackers I'm getting the same scam mail I will be deleting it and getting something that shows it's working, it always says zero block, when I know for sure I'm still unsafe, it doesn't do it explain anything about it when I click on it, I gave it one star that's low as I could go, I feel like it's just another app taking storage space, it's not doing anything here as I can see, then I tried reading reviews before download no chance"
139170,"i love the browser just some problems i am un able to access some sites Which are easy to open using Chrome or any other browser to acces that i have to use a vpn with this browser , can u do something about it"
139173,"The back arrow goes back to home and I have to find the tab again and reopen. When I tried to leave feedback through your play store link, it just did a web search for feedback. Ridiculous. The auto blocking of trackers makes me want to keep this around but if I can't even use the back button then this belongs in the trash."
139188,"This app was working fine for me for awhile but for some reason now everytime I search literally anything on the browser I can't scroll down. I'm limited to the first couple options given to me which are always ads and not useful. I'm uninstalling and going to another anonymous browser until this is fixed."
139194,"Great for everything but video which stutters even at 360p. I needed a browser that would allow me to watch YouTube without using the app."
139207,"Does what it says with privacy and that's good. But everything else is rubbish. Browsing experience feels outdated."
139222,"Needs a bit of work. It has a bug on websites that makes the words big and lap over each other and can't read it or click what you want to go into."
139224,"The Key board is hit and miss to come up when tapping in a search box. Back issue still happening, browser seems to go stale randomly where it doesnt do anything, all the buttons respond so it's not frozen but they dont do anything no pages will load have to completely close all tabs and close the browser right out and start over. Lots of major bugs still need worked out."
139238,"Its okay but it doesn't always stop websites tracking you plus if you're using a Web browser on PC it hardly works at all and it doesn't warn you on what websites are bad for tracking and what are good :/"
139241,"When I do a search directly through this app a lot of time I get no hits. I can take the same exact search and search on Firefox with duckduckgo as the default search engine and I get lots of hits. Evey time I open the app it wants me to verify who I am when no other browse does this Uninstalling"
139245,"My wifi strength is strong... But i am unable search ..... After searching it come out to be webpage not available"
139253,"Every time I go to use it , it kicks me right off the second it loads , fix the problem and I will re-rate your app, until then I'll keep using chrome"
139263,"No home page - at least none that I can find - so no way to have favorite sites easily available. I switch around a lot so this is a problem for me. I sent feedback about it so hopefully it will be in a later version. For now, this doesn't meet my needs so I'll move on."
139280,"So much nicer and better thought out than the chrome browser, especially when you open multiple tabs. *UPDATED Review - after an update, my phone woke me up in the middle of the night with a notification from duck duck go to show me a very self congratulatory 'privacy report' of how many cookies it's blocked, ironic from a browser that's about privacy. This rubbish shouldn't be pushed as a notification."
139283,"The app has difficulty with yahoo mail and page refreshing. Trying to go "back" often sends you to the DDG home page. Its come a long ways but still needs work."
139291,"I don't trust this at all. Been using it for a week and I've had more targeted ads etc popping up in my emails and social media for things that I've specifically searched for on this browser than I ever had using google. Also my Netflix account was hacked 3 days after downloading this app and I only very recently changed my password to a very secure password and it immediately gets hacked after using this app. Be very careful"
139294,"The App is Ok. But I think and request the developer to make it like other browsing features like that of chrome but with security and privacy ... Yes data is important but also give added features and beta updates of new competitors like chrome canary etc ... At least some basic add-ons should be given like Good UI detail saver but local saved and encrypted and"
139310,"It's time to uninstall this browser as it has lost most of its quality and has become add focused browser. Thanks for ur service, I liked it a lot but can't stand a good browsing experience because of the pop-up add on every click."
139312,"Business searches don't make phone numbers one-click entries, and the results aren't always what I'm looking for (and am able to find with other search engines), but I like the movement to take control of our data."
139319,"WARNING THIS APP IS NOT A VPN! This app is only good for searching data on the Duckduckgo site, it offers absolutely NO privacy when visiting other websites and compromises your privacy. This app is utterly useless for searching the web for information. They're latest policies have killed any uniqueness they had. Duckduckgo is just a standard search engine now, one you can visit with any other browser for the same "privacy" effect. This app is pointless."
139323,"Poor effort. Who in their right mind thought "i know, everytime a user does anything we'll have a notification that slooooowly appears on the screen and has to be cleared before they can do anything else, even viewing the site they went to in the first place"? Really? What a joke. Looks like im stuck with google until someone cracks this obviously hugely difficult task of viewing a web page on a mobile and it not being a frustrating experience."
139344,"Listen, this apps ad on youtube stated that google was targeting you with ads, but they dont understand a feature about google, youtube, and Facebook that allows you to turn personalized ads off. Instead of trying to tell people that they can turn personalized ads off to be safe, they made an app about it to profit off the apps popularity, this whole thing just proves that you cant trust anyone, including the people who "are trying to help""
139346,"back button from a newly-opened tab does not take you back to the original page/tab that you started from. while the browser has some nice features, until this issue is fixed, the app is unusable."
139352,"Images are a little disappointing because this app doesn't show similar images under them. Otherwise a decent app mainly because of it cares about privacy (unlike one specific company lol)."
139357,"I have the Bitdefender Total Security 2020 mobile app which also includes an anti-virus software. The DuckDuckGo browser is not on the protected browser list so I no longer using it."
139361,"Hi, love app but fyi, it still wont open from homepage, I am using latest version of android on Samsung Galaxy Note 9. Yes! They have share function👍😉 I use this search engine for any serious research that is scrubbed by Google. Thank you for keeping it real👏👏👏"
139391,"Browser is good for what it does but could be improved 1-- refresh button should be more accessible 2-- auto reload when lost connection is regained (but not that pull down to refresh in chrome please) 3-- data saving by image compression maybe 4--downloading is not reliable"
139400,"I couldn't find the songs I downloaded from a site into my phone. I checked every folder in my phone. They don't exist. UPDATE: Downloads are still not downloading as of 4-25-20. The site says my songs are successfully downloaded but this browser does not download them."
139406,"Works as it says if I use it in English. When I try to find something in my native language (dutch) it keeps giving me a lot of irrelevant English results. Still use it as much as possible because of the privacy perks, but in Dutch I still use google sometimes."
139411,"I love this browser before the update! I hate the new floating menu bar 😭 I know that floating bar looks more simple and stylish or whatever, but previous lower bar is much more accessible, considering Android devices of today are 6' or more! Floating menu bar is TROUBLESOME."
139416,"It is a great app but there is a lot of room for improvement like, its needs to include an option to block ads and a buffer booster for online videos with on screen controls to adjust volume and brightness."
139433,"I just went from five stars to 1. I updated the app recently and my tabs and bookmarks have disappeared I can't get to them unless I do a search for something else and then they pop up. I have written to the developer twice and they don't answer me."
139455,"when opening some link DDG shows up blank. is only until i return to previous page then hit the link again and then I'm sent to the site. very frustrating s9 Update: 5/2020 isn't auto clearing on "app exit". Adjusted settings. I have to manually hit the flame icon to clear."
139469,"Every time you hit the back button you have to start your search ALL OVER. Even if your in a map trying to get the correct location entered. It's more time consuming and aggravating than it's worth."
139487,"Good browser. I rated only three stars and will increase it to five if the developers add in a way to better organize bookmarks. I would like to see a drop-down menu like Google Chrome and Internet Explorer have for organizing bookmarks."
139504,"The browser is quite slow sometimes. Please make it better. Thank You!!!! I like knowing that my search is private. That what I search for is not spread throughout the Internet. Will continue to use for my Internet needs and trash Google."
139526,"Not sure if or how privacy is better or different but I'd change it to 4 or 5 stars if they would fix it to where when you select open in new tab it didn't close tab your in and jump to new tab if it did it like chrome or Firefox where it opens new tab but keeps you on same page or at least have option of doing it that'd b so much better"
139529,"Great concept, buy very unfinished. No bookmark importing/exporting, no voice inputs because keyboards (Gboard) think it's "in private browsing mode", sites don't redirect to their app counterparts, many sites not supported."
139548,"This browser does not appear to have a download option. That's very odd and, unfortunately, means that I am unable to use this otherwise excellent browser."
139574,"Rating 3 stars because it's the best browser ever, this is much better than Chrome, i rated 3 stars because everytime i go to google and look up something, and look up an another one, it keeps messing up and enters the same search that i went to 😞 Do the best you can, stay safe 💚"
139585,"There is ad blocks but there is no stopping from auto pop-ups and redirecting ad sites. Ur ad block works on the ads that are present on current page only. Not the lots of sites ot loading ehile entering to a website. Anyhow I loved the app."
139586,"Nice minimalistic browser, but please add an option to shift the toolbar at the bottom side so that it becomes much easier to switch the tabs. And please add a offline-page feature, the lack of which keeps me using chrome. That's why keeping two remaining star."
139598,"Used to work great. Now, after the most recent update, it has stopped working. It never loads any web page, ever. It gets stuck loading at the halfway point and never proceeds"
139608,"So far I have to say it performs as good as chrome and Samsung browser. Samsung pass seems to work with it. Convenient. Haven't explored all features yet. Hope it's as user-friendly as Samsung."
139631,"Overall the browser is good at maintaining privacy and blocks trackers but the tab menu is so dam ugly that it sucks! The fire 🔥 button is good concept but doesn't work for everyone! Add some new features like Swipe to next tab And the setting menu is also ugly plz take a look over it!"
139663,"Useless app. I wanted to switch from chrome to this browser but it just don't work properly. Many sites don't even open, some features like filling forms and logging in don't work. Clicking Instagram links doesn't open instagram app. This app is just garbage to browse internet."
139673,"Need additional features Give features like pull down to refresh and don't open search links in New tabs always. Give a toggle to do that. Thanks"
139681,"It lacks: save file as/save link as, print, etc. It only works as a reader, can't download files that lack a download button. Works to read the paper. Needs save, print, etc functions."
139688,"Duck Duck go more like duck duck scam. This app makes me feel miserable for even using it. The app doesn't even feel right and it doesn't even work! The app is creepy and it is so creepy that it's ads follow me every regularly!!!! Google sends ads on YouTube so Youtuber's can make money. I hate however the fact that Duck duck go ads keep following me! Just to clarify the ads of Google are getting worse following people by interest. Interestingly enough this app is run by Google but hey right😡"
139717,"performance could be better, the scroll wheel sometimes just bugs out won't scroll down beyond a certain point, forcing me to refresh the page i'm currently on, but overall pretty good."
139738,"This is a good concept but unfortunately google still track you. Whenever I've used chrome for whatever reason, all the searches I made on this app were listed in order in chrome's history. So you can't escape it, you still get tracked."
139741,"Annoying how I cannot stop it being the default browser. If I am in chrome, a link will open in DDG. I don't want it to but have no option. Switching off Default Browser in DDG does nothing and is still set when I next check."
139746,"New problem since last update. When doing a search, if you click a link to a page and then want to go back to the search results, it takes you to a blank page. You have to reenter search terms and start over."
139758,"Everything is damn gud but the app is not stable.. if i use few tabs at the same time and then the tabs shows the home page when i go out and comes in. It's fishy and ridiculous. Plea make it stable as possible. Thanks in advance"
139761,"I recently uninstalled uc browser for security issues. The best thing about uc is the way it provides option to download all videos streamed. Please add that feature then 5 star guaranteed. Also a strong ad pop-up blocker like brave browser."
139764,"Love almost everything about it except if you have a long list of results to search and you click a link, when you go back to the results you are taken back to the initial page of results and have to scroll through the results all over again. So frustrating."
139771,"Decent and pretty secure browser for a mobile but is lacking the basic functionality of having webpages always open as a "desktop site" Most mobile sites are still terrible and having to refresh every page after opening is infuriating."
139778,"The back button behavior needs a lot of work. I open a new tab from a page when I click back I should return to previous page, but no I only see empty page with DDG logo. So annoying behavior."
139796,"Till 3/28 had no problems since 3/29 was not able to use even once, 43 pop up messages, " app.keeps stopping " uninstalled & reinstalled the same issue. There was also problem to reinstal got message my phone is not comparable ? Galaxy s10+.??? Will try again, if not, must permanently say goodbye"
139805,"Well I really like the privacy this browser offers, but being I can not download anything in DDG this browser is useless to me. Downloads work in other browser's, chrome, Firefox etc. It seems like I need to switch back to another browser unfortunately. Or is there a fix?"
139840,"Needs to improve ip tracking and hiding of ip address. Overall great app. But an inbuilt vpn would be great."
139845,"Nice, but only pulls up sites offering answers but then once on the site, only if you buy their service or product. Getting just common facts is at best difficult. I can easily delete my cookies, &browsing history and save on this search time, if that is all im looking for."
139850,"Some really good features with lots of potential but it really does appear to be quite slow? Also despite changing the settings to give me more suitable UK based results it sometimes misses the mark..."
139855,"Was better before Google bought it. Also it goes a little too far with the privacy thing. God forbid you accidentally touch the wrong part the screen (totally never happens) and forget about where you were or what you were doing... Gone."
139857,"Private info still being sent to websites! I visited a website on the browser and the next day I received an email from them even though I never provided them my email. Very disappointed that they would share my private email."
139874,"I like this app very much but Night mode does not work with website even thought it is turned on... Websites background is still white therefore it is not comfortable to eye sights at night. I appreciate if this is improved."
139877,"Enjoying but spam starting popping up. It's very irritating because I downloaded this browser because he make promises of no spam and easy browsing. I had enjoy it until yesterday when the pop ads of winning something starting popping up all of sudden."
139913,"cant download videos like I do pictures like on every other browser. many log in options including Google auto login buttons are broken. i appreciate the effort but this browser is just a hassle. Used for 3-4 months and cant stand it any more."
139918,"Its not a bad app! Love the privacy aspect. But it dosent take you everywhere you'll want to go. Some searches come up empty. But everything is a trade off."
139927,"Super cool as a search engine. It's my default. But you gotta beat Opera Touch as browser. Everyone must give it a try to feel that the Chrome and FireFox is the old way to browse. By the way"
139936,"Fire button appears be broken or I'm misunderstanding its function. Tabs are removed when the button is pressed but some data, primarily a bit of history is still being retained. This needs to be remedied immediately."
139947,"Normally I'd give it 5/5 but the recent update wiped out almost all my saved homescreen shortcuts. I was using those as reminders so I have no way of replacing them. Not cool. Hold off on updating if you can, or at least save all your shortcuts as URLs first."
139954,"Awesome but needs to be able to import bookmarks from IE or Chrome and why does it keep opening new tabs? It's too frustrating to use as your main search engine."
139966,"Screens lock up after about 30 minutes of use mid-page load. Super annoying, and you have to shut the program down and reopen to get it to work again."
139986,"Keeping your info private, unlike google who tracks, sells and uses your information... but it takes forever to load a simple page if it even loads at all. Sometimes I have to use Google because I just can't do anything on this."
139994,""Desktop Site" setting does not stick. I need to view full websites all the time without constantly clicking on Desktop Site, therefore I cannot use this browser until this is fixed."
140004,"The only issue i face is when I try to open any links via this browser it does not take me to the app already installed on my phone but to the browser version of that app which is frustrating. Can the dev team work on it.."
140009,"No tracking policy is really awesome. Easy to use becomes very difficult some times viewing photos. Go to all tabs then close that photo tab otherwise hitting back button will exit browser. Where is download menu ?"
140023,"Overall decent browser but crashes often and two open tabs may congeal into the same tab twice so you have to redo the lost tab."
140024,"So far so good!! Just testing this app. I like the fact that this is supposed to be private when researching. Will edit this rating in the future when I have a little bit more experience with this app. Thank you."
140047,"Pretty cool all in all, but I really miss the important browser options like "block all popups" and "block scripting"... this app's settings menu is sadly rather ... devoid of features."
140062,"It's useless when opening sites that require a digi id to login. The digi id app is supposed to start up when logging in, but instead I get the old login screen, which fails. Other browsers don't have this problem."
140073,"Lot of differences from Google. It does not look good. 1. Problems while playing youtube videos such as screen rotation (cornoring image. 2. Both Logo Image & search results interface also looks bad. Logo looks like a Cartoon image"
140087,"I am changing my review. Duck Duck Go is filtering out my searches. Things I could search for last week now don't appear on the search bar, but I can easily find them other search sites. I am switching to another search engine."
140107,"Did work very well now takes forever to return search results on my samsung tablet. Cannot recommrnd anymore and have removed"
140109,"Downloaded it today. Will not let me download anything. No reason given. Just blank page so that will he uninstalled. No use to me if I cant see for example conditions of a new bank account before I open. A reason should be given. So its gone. Dont bother"
140116,"Consumers need clarity about which search engine is really being used. What about trackers and search results data? I noticed ads through my Instagram feed based on my duckduckgo search history😠👎 I have screen shots of my duckduckgo searches and the new ad feeds from Instagram. I haven't used any other search engines for months."
140135,"Everything is good, just missing option like download, lite, data saving mode, pull down to refresh page.."
140151,"I chose this browser for its lack of popups, as many do. Interrupting me 13 times in less than a week to ask me for a rating on the play store kind of defeats the purpose"
140156,"Automatic exit option is nice.. Best👍 speed in browsing...and vpn selection in searching page is good..👎 downloading error in this browser. When we download a content then show "download unsuccessful" after a little bit time."
140167,"Getting used to it. Doesn't answer my questions, like Google it is hard to get to what I'm looking for. Wants to direct me elsewhere. Maybe it's also sensoring my searches like I feel Google does."
140169,"Pretty good, and I know this might be a difficult fix, but I think it should have a simple built in vpn, used only when the app is open."
140181,"Please add a download or offline option for webpages and also look out for the usual file download function of the app, it do don't works properly. Alas! The marketing the publisher did."
140195,"Yesterday, I used the DDG app to search for cell phones, and today, despite not signing in, I'm getting cell phone ads on yahoo. The reson I abandoned Chrome in favor of DDG, was to end this ridiculous tracking invasion."
140206,"If I click a link that opens a new tab, when I press back it doesn't take me back to the tab I was on before. That's quite annoying. Also please add the pull down to refresh functionality."
140252,"I was very happy with the app until I spent 3 hours downloading images and then they all got deleted after I unistalled the app (needed to free up some space as the images took a lot of space)"
140257,"Works as expected, would have been better if it could retain the webpages in the background even after the app has been closed or swiped out. Didn't know it crashes and all the tabs opened are gone too. I am using a moto G5S+"
140270,"I think that for me as a basic user this app is a awesome because is fast, easy use and light,Thanks."
140280,"Using the back button brings up a window with the Duck Duck Go logo, rather than taking you back to the previous page. Fix that and it's well on the way."
140282,"Simply not a great search engine and equally as biased/cencored as Google. And unfortunately on some searches I'm forced to go back to Google to find the data I'm after. I will continue to search for a better option."
140294,"Love duckduckgo and would gladly give five stars but after the last update it no longer opens. I have to uninstall it and reinstall. It works for a bit the problem persists."
140296,"Everything is fine, but it doesnt have option to translate any page & some sites require Ad to run , so it would be better if i could turn on & off adblocker myself."
140318,"It's nice to have a privacy app. However it is not immune from political bias. Seems the search algorithms present almost entirely left wing viewpoints/sites."
140343,"Has been timing out for 2 weeks now. I have uninstalled and reinstalled but no avail. I am deleting and finding a different service."
140358,"Burn feature and tab count etc have moved to the bottom of the screen. Here they are obscured by the keyboard. Please return to the top."
140389,"When ever click on a video to play it in a certain website. It redirects me to a new website scam this doesn't work out as I expected it too. Still shows Ad pop ups too."
140392,"I would have given five stars if there was a way to display dark webpages. I am so used to dark mode that, I feel very uncomfortable looking at white background."
140401,"I do like the fact that this browser blocks tracking, but the more I use it, the less I liked it as a browser. The developers have a long long way to go... Update, removing this app..."
140412,"I don't like that when you click a link, it opens in a new tab then when you press back it brings that tab to the home screen. It should close that tab and bring me back to the first tab"
140418,"Samsung Internet automatically dark website background. I love duckduckgo but I miss the feature. Can you please add it?"
140451,"I like the feeling of security, but the browser locks up too frequently for 10 or 20 seconds each time. Needs a fix."
140461,"Works well. But sometimes some web widgets doesn't work as expected. Also, password or biometric security is expected from a privacy focused browser."
140463,"OMG I never tried this app before. if you add a feature called "lock toolbar while browsing" please that would be great!"
140476,"What good is a browser that keeps no records if you ISP is keeping track of everything you do?! Someone somewhere is always watching!!"
140483,"Speed is amazing, however, when searching a web address .co.uk doesnt come up as a suggestion until you finish typing the full address( I.e. Amazon.co.uk, Ebay.co.uk etc etc"
140497,"It's good with a touch screen but needs scroll bars for Chromebook! Update 2020: still needs scroll bars, also needs easy access to bookmarks (on the bar) otherwise performs well!"
140516,"I don't like the browser giving me tips and comments while I use it. I also can't connect to youtube."
140517,"It freezes a lot. Just now froze up when i hit Back arrow to go to a sites main page. Have to go back to opera or brave. About to uninstall it shortly."
140534,"its clean and fast but you cannot get all that chrome features which can give a ton of customizations if you want a clean browser go for it but if you do like tweaking then it would not be your type"
140562,"It's as close as you can get to the old internet before google and facebook ruined it. They're starting to cover up articles JUST like google now. Changed from 5 stars to 1"
140564,"What the hell 😵 At least you can add feature to make the search bar to bottom. It is difficult for the users who have long phone to reach the thumb at the top..... 100 km far away from my thumb 😤😤😤"
140565,"Privacy is very good. I would like to have a method to organize bookmarks. The help site could as be more useful and user friendly."
140575,"I was looking at something for my dog and I saw all the stuff I was looking at on YouTube and on videos kept popping up, it works going onto website's... Sometimes, but overall it's a good app...kinda"
140580,"Can't give 5 star for this app as it's very difficult to set as default and even if its not tracking but at the end bing or other browsers working with this are tracking my searches and keep history..."
140600,"Not bad but gives little control. Also not good that the back button doesn't work and you loose the URL forever"
140612,"1. Must have " forcefully zooming " option. 2. Downloading in background is unsupportive. 3. History block is missing from menu, downloaded file block too."
140629,"Needs improvement, doesn't save history, every time you have to type. Search results are better than Google."
140677,"Can't use voice to text. Don't like the search results as well as other browser. Like being incognito."
140678,"Most options in the settings menu are not accessible or clickable, i.e. add bookmark. Needs work. Other than that it seems to be ok."
140680,"Good app , main problem i was facing that , if i open 2 tab and back for second tab in several time it didn't go for 1 tab its directly close app, seriously its very irritating , do something , thank you..."
140725,"This browser needs a lot of work. This is my 3rd time back. Every time i go back a page it just goes to start page. very annoying. Not having it."
140733,"There's no options to: (1) Block JavaScript. (2) Block ALL cookies. (3) Set custom User-Agent. (4) HTTPS Only. (5) Share images (not only the url)."
140755,"after clicking "open something in a new tab" button, instead of directly seeing the new window it would be better to stay the page i was looking at. just a little opinion***"
140759,"Only 2 star rating because Duck duck go is now "filtering" results like google does, ive noticed this pattern just within the last 4 months.... Other than that duck duck go is amazing."
140790,"Using it for years, One issue I have found, In stock android (10) When I pinned the app and then try to clear the history it acts weirdly."
140791,"Similar to Chrome. Needs lots of development. There's no download viewing option. No exit option. Settings too short. Non customisable. Give it a good custom settings."
140801,"App decided to update itself but deleted itself first, which removed the dozens of shortcuts I that I had created on my home page. What a badly thought out upgrade strategy. I'm back to using Firefox."
140848,"It's great, but when I press back it takes me right out of the site I'm in to the search page. Can this be fixed please?"
140865,"What I don't like about this is when you search there's no previous or next page facility. It's extreamly annoying."
140872,"good privacy browser but needs lots of work as so much times it doesn't block trackers from B grade sites"
140873,"One of the slowest browsers I have ever used. It's a darn shame because the privacy is really great, but its so slow that its not worth keeping."
140885,"New update has ruined the app. I can no longer open a new tab on the browser. Opening a new tab closes the current tab. Totally unusable. Please fix this"
140905,"No issues yet... love the privacy features. Edit: Used to love it and use it all the time... now some videos will not play so I deleted the app."
140941,"Doesn't let me scroll past loading ad videos I don't want to see anyway. When choosing what to open a page with (app or browser) it claims the browser is actually google chrome. So that's sketchy."
140947,"Site loads to 30% and stucks. It doesn't load at all. I see a lot of positive comments here. But my experience is negative so far"
140968,"with lack of features. . .browser with add-on support still better (especially for ads blocking) *still waiting for next. . .as i'm using DDG S.E. for daily searching,,"
140996,"Cons: webpage loading is very slow. No built in download manager. Not user friendly. Laggy UI. Pros: Nice browser for Privacy."
141009,"Lately ads are showing up, rev content ads. Too bad, too disruptive, no feedback despite writting emails."
141023,"Desktop site support is not accurate for most of the websites. There's no difference between Mobile and desktop site. That's bad."
141028,"Update: Stop with the silly popups! Alternate browser search commensing... It's aight. Allows media autoplay, popups, and other html5 shenanigans. So....it's Chrome with a duck"
141046,"Mostly positive experience. I would like to add that I wish it had a voice search option the way Google does."
141047,"Good, and it is very important to have an alternative to google, but it needs work. Voice recognition would be nice."
141064,"I'm really behind on times when it comes to computers. Love having the convince of a phone but trying to educate and protect myself with it comes to my personal and private information from being tracked and dispensed thru-out the world. Thanks for helping and providing this app."
141068,"Is a good app overall but after the last update it wont remember any settings and that cloud function wants you to log in every time you open the app. Definitely a downgrade. Bit disappointed."
141069,"Stops working frequently. I have to uninstall & reinstall a few times each month, losing all my bookmarks. Using a new Samsung phone."
141084,"So far so good. Will update if i encounter problems, but it seems to be a better browser and search engine than Google's."
141085,"Before updating but after browsing for about a month, the browser kept forgetting what site I was on... but it did block MOST of the ads."
141090,"Somewhat Limited in the range of things I can find but overall I appreciate the fact that listen to trace me. However does have links to other search engines that do so I'm not sure how safe it actually ends up being."
141131,"Much better after all. Bye Opera. Still doesn't render pages well, but private. Even seems to bock popups."
141137,"After the new build app doesn't clean out all search information or "burn it" if I type in a similar search it will auto populat the window with all the searches since the last update. plz fix thank you."
141142,"Very good application... Ad blocker.. pretty good... My request & opinion- please include the "downloads" option ... Mobile stock "downloads" Is very slow...."
141154,"Good app but I think the app needs to be able to download not only for browsing and streaming videos. Other than that I think it's a great app"
141168,"I was enjoying using this browser untill it kept failing to load anything. Uninstalled and reinstalled which fixed it for about 30 minutes and now its doing the same thing."
141195,"It is great for going dark, but unsure as too how effective it is in protecting my info from more advanced hackers. But its a good app, not the best but well"
141230,"It's good browser but I don't see download option where I can pause and resume that download So if that's option added in the browser. So it's better to be enjoy"
141252,"No data saving, bodgy tabs, not helping wise up on script hosts (moat, onesignal, wretched ad blurters and linkbaiters, all the candidates for adding as localhost to hosts.) It's 40MB in the way, sorry!"
141263,"I like the idea of this browser, but it takes longer to load than google on some sites. It also gives me errors trying to load some pages"
141301,"Love it, BUT...Keeps freezing on Verizon Elipses tablet. NEEDS refresh button and better bookmark button & system. Fix those and keep anonymity then 5 stars."
141314,"Good for privacy, but sometimes the keyboard doesn't come up when you click inside a text field e.g. search field on website."
141333,"Now a days it has become worst browser. If I have open a tab after some time it is asking to reload. please fix this problem."
141353,"I can't download most files, from .pdf, .docx, to apk It's a suffering knowing they haven't patched this for months or even years."
141378,"It's different then used to so adjusting! Can use a little more work but considering the safety, it's worth it!"
141382,"Pretty good browser. Devs should add the ability to rearrange bookmarks. Would rate it higher if they did."
141406,"Can't block a single popup, no extension support, no importing bookmarks. Trying to find something positive to say but it's difficult with Duckduck."
141412,"More secured sites will no longer allow me to log in stating this browser is out of date. So moving on to a more up to date browser."
141436,"One of the worst browser, full of ads. Cookies, irritating , automatically downloads ads and app links, this app should have negative rating .0"
141445,"The app is fine and all but whenever im on a other like a game or youtube, its takes me out and takes me to a site thats usally porn and it gets really annoying. Ive tried reinstalling and unistalling but it doest stop"
141446,"Very slow and often hangs. I think if the developer poloshes the op procedures and menus, it would be a great App!"
141451,"When I opened my DDG browser, I could not get rid of the Career Builder webpage. I had not even accessed Career Builder in DDG but it was CLEARLY accessing my emails!!"
141454,"It has helped me to enter restricted websites without problems and i can explore the internet without having to face any challenges"
141461,"No way to access any open tabs now. I still love DDG, but it is a pain to have to do a search to access other tabs you have open."
141476,"Click leads to parent to child tab, then why back button doesn't lead to child to parent tab, instead it exits the browser. Download pdf option pls. Full screen option pls. Download options/ folder."
141479,"Please add the feature to pull refresh Web page. Also bring the fire animation that is there on iOS to android also. Why not add an ad blocker like Brave browser?"
141500,"The idea of privacy is a good thing but I think this is just waaaay too slow (I mean it, pages take FOREVER to load). Neutral thoughts in summary."
141540,"Needs an Add blocker. I try to watch shows in FireFox and the screen shuts off. Instead i try in this app and i get sent to all these sites whenever i touch the screen. Need AdBlocker Add-on"
141554,"The app is good but still some important feature is missing. Add adblocking option and add speed dial in home interface."
141566,"Improve with : quick access start page; go to top button; zoom in page; Plus: do not require many permission, privacy is fine"
141611,"It just goes towards " no results" or something. I look up like Kirby or H. Yes H. The app can't even recognize H all of a sudden. If you fix this I'll rate five."
141693,"Something happened probably in the last update but pages won't open properly, won't open at all or they would open after quite a long time. What happened guys? ಥ╭╮ಥ"
141695,"Works fine but doesn't let me use my preferred SwiftKey theme. Forced to use black theme. Why I rarely use it."
141703,"I have tried to install it in my PC, however, so far it has been impossible. Every time I try to download it, it says that it's already installed in my cellphone and doesn't allow me to install it in my PC. Why there is no easy way to do this? If you want people to use your browser, it should be easy to install it."
141749,"Reload/refresh page by swiping down should be there. New tab button should be put either at the bottom ot at the place of the fire button."
141802,"My apologies. Every browser I've tried crashes. It must be my Huawei phone? It never did this till Corona hit!"
141806,"Hey, I'm new & really don't no what all yall do. I C your logo pop up every now & then but it hasn't hurt me so I like it. I'm 73 & not very IT savy, so if U have any type of tutorial give an old man a bone. MF"
141830,"So Many ads pop up appear on screen, no ads blocker, private mode always appear on toggle bar but browsing speed is awesome."
141862,"Much smaller than Chrome. Dark theme does not affect menus. Needs bookmark widget. Popped up notification while using Chrome. Can not open-with local HTML."
141864,"The page is hard to control, can't reload by pulling down the page cant swipe tab. It's too old but good"
141879,"Differnt search results than other engines. But love the lack of spam resulting from use. Thanks duck duck go."
141888,"First thing it should support external download manager and second thing is that sometimes its not able to copy links."
141932,"Not being able to import or export bookmark. Updated 5/23/20: display problem: it doesn't even show the text from Yahoo mails!"
141979,"This is more left wing biased than bing and chrome. It brings up the opposite of what you search for in favour of the far left Democrats. Uninstalled now!"
142019,"Does hide your browsing from other applications on your phone specially Facebook. I get ads on facebook based on my search history from this browser. Started seeing similar ads on YouTube as well."
142045,"I love this app. But it always crash on my Android please we need a update. It's the one of the best browsers app have ever used."
142087,"Wanting to escape evils of Google &.Microsoft..I tried DuckDuckGo..its present performance is sub-par...I hope it can improve.."
142210,"Thank you for all the youtube ads! How did you know that my privicy does not matter to you and I love all the useless ads. Great job.... NOT!"
142252,"the previous dark mode is better than current black mode. Add an option to select dark mode kind atleast."
142273,"Trackers are not blocked. I did one search for a Dell computer using this and right when I went to facebook guess what Dell computers were being advertised."
142324,"Im giving two star because on YouTube I wanted to see your add again I came across a video about the news on this app. And the people talking actually worked there AND had a professional searcher or something like that. He said that this app MAY be giving Google our personal information. I do trust this app so I will keep it but If I dont feel safe anymore anytime soon I will have to delete it."
142349,"After updating to the newest version, themes not working properly, please fix this it's simple but really annoying for someone who want to stick with some interface, thanks"
142356,"Somewhat complete security features..I understand there are no browsers out there that offer 100% privacy ,so this will have to do for now..New user for the last month so judge my comments as a new user semi pro black hacker..laugh"
142367,"last time i gave it 5 stars coz i was definitely amazed but after i went on different downloading sites, it doesn't let me download, i love this app bec yena is a duck. plus it cannot open files after i downloaded some files"
142416,"Want to so use this app but cannot until following are applied... * PRINT OPTION * * OWN KEYBOARD ALLOWED * * HOME PAGE * * REFRESH BUTTON * * ALTERNATE SEARCH ENGINES OTHER THAN DD * 👍Just seen 2 billboard posters in Falkirk area 👍*"
142439,"Uninstalling. This app takes forever to open pages, decides which websites to block popups, etc...Not impressed!"
142507,"Completely stopped loading pages after last update. Not going to reinstall, because I don't want to lose bookmarks."
142542,"Since the last update, my settings (theme, country, units etc.) are being changed to default every time I exit the app. Please fix this"
142568,"Can no longer be trusted. Why is it sending packets to Amazonaws every time I turn on my Tablet or Phone WHEN I AM NOT EVEN RUNNING IT. Why this spying? Opera and Firefox don't do it. Why aren't we told up front about this."
142613,"Would've have given five stars if your suggestions and relevance algorithms were good, I just made a shortcut for Google and use DuckDuckGo."
142634,"Okay but gmail website loads slow on this compared to others. Responsive mode detection not very good."
142683,"Decent browser but themes/settings revert back to default however many times you save & exit...bizarre...😏"
142691,"i was a regular user of this browser, After New update this app isnot working in my phone . it doesn't load any website."
142704,"No global dark theme. If the Samsung Internet browser can have it, all the other browsers can too. The devs are just too lazy. Btw that talking duck is really annoying. You can't even shut it up."
142724,"Program gives away your timezones setting (in Android it's something like AMERICA/LOSANGELES ) which also gives away your location. Thereby defeating the point of using a VPN."
142750,"With the new update it killed all the links that I left in the home page: could not trust it anymore."
142789,"I tryed using it but it keep popping up ads and I had to re look up with I was doing over and over again"
142793,"Security is supposed to be good, but search results are terrible and I frequently have to go back to Google."
142796,"Old problem occurs again: DDG Search settings (dark theme, safesearch off) are wiped when using the flame button or closing the browser."
142856,"Videos on pornhub don't work, copied the link to another browser to check and it works fine but on DuckDuckGo it doesn't. Please check."
142961,"Could there be an option to disable the "duck hints and tips" in the settings? I feel it would help, especially with users reinstalling the app."
142963,"It censors results. I checked results against Google and Bing, and adult sites we're all filtered. I also checked news sites, same again. This is a real shame."
142997,"You would think amazon own duckduckgo as in uk thats mostly what search results list. Most search results are websites in U.S.A, i tried but its got even worse don't bother installing."
143051,"Despite all the apps great features, they need to fix the back button feature. This one annoyance totally kills the app and makes me not want to use it at all."
143172,"I dont get the information whether my wifi is misused.i dont get the display of wifi thiefs.then how to block by duckduck go.i dont undetstand the method of functioning of duckduck go.it would be better if a detailed explanation of how to find and block wifi thief."
143208,"This prg. pops up the cloacal facebook ad that will not close and forces users to reboot to close window."
143212,"Cant really see if it's doing what it said it's doing also still not getting all search results I'm looking for."
143250,"No adblocker, it irretates with ads & 1 suggestion adblocker+inbuilt VPN can make this app the best one."
143270,"It good to for browsing private but search engine is less straightforward than other big players engines"
143278,"Downgrading my rating on this from 5 to 3 stars, primarily because of the really poor bookmark management system."
143452,"Android user, drag word input doors not automatically put spaces in like moat apps do. Other wise its pretty good."
143506,"App keep.jumping confront of other apps as if I have to use it or will not give me access to other app."
143542,"Was good at first, but now im getting targeted ads for things i look up only in duckduckgo,private i think not"
143572,"Not show Downloading. By confusion 1 file download in 7 to 8 times, many data loss. So boring duck teacher logo and hints during search."
143578,"The app update on 3-27-2020 deleted all my saved website icons!! Ugh!! How do I get them back? It also deleted the app icon from my main screen."
143679,"Is that sad i will block the adds.This is a stupid app. and it cant block any adds thats have virus or pop ups or any other adds..Please dont download this cheat. Please go with opera"
143722,"Duck ignores it's users. I've been asking for a year how to prevent the app browser from opening a new tab everytime I open a link and they just blow me off. I don't want 12 tabs open when I'm using Twitter, I want just one."
143738,"I find it does track you all of a sudden. Google is now in control of it. It has been mentioned before on the news media."
143842,"Me downloads DDG to help protect privacy and stop getting targeted with ads that "feel so creepy"...... Starts getting bombarded with ads to download DDG😐....."
143901,"It's kinda better than chrome the only problem it has that it won't fall for her some of the movies I watch"
143951,"Hey! Thanks for repeatedly asking me to rate your app after I've already rated it. Apparently 5 stars wasn't enough so now I'm trying 1 star. Cheers!"
143995,"I can't look anything up accurately. Any website I use doesn't function fully such as face book. Terrible experience."
144209,"Hi. Great app. I use it for all my searches. I have one question how do i use the images that i download from the website."
144226,"Try the "white couple/black couple" challenge and you'll see this browser is censored with a liberal bias just like Google. First, search images of black couples. Surprise! You see black couples. Then Asian couples. Same thing. Gay couples? Yep, you'll see gay couples. Mixed race couples? Again, you get what you asked for. But if you have the systemically racist audacity to search for white couples? Guess what you get? Mixed race couples. Gay couples. Black couples. Not white couples. Try it."
144307,"I think this app default running browser is Google, a tracking one. So...... I don't feel i have privacy."
144340,"Couldn't figure out if they are worse at a Search-Engine or the Browser! Probably both products keep competing to be worse than the other!"
144382,"Really like the bottom toolbar style, but after I updated, it backs to default style, could you please add the feature back?"
144383,"Need option to set home page. Also images are getting downloaded in .bin format which no handset supports, pls have this fixed"
144409,"Only had it a few days but pretty good so far. I think it just come out with a non biased filter for social media"
144437,"Very surprised to see that DuckDuckGo is censoring web search results for "jaydon hayden" (the horrible black guy who abused elderly nursing home patients in Michigan). I tried Bing and got multiple applicable web results using their search. I have used the DuckDuckGo browser for years and I'm totally disappointed. I expected a censor free web search experience."
144511,"We cant see downloads and we have to go download manager and at my another phone i am not able to open download manager and file got lost and make rip of 3GB daily data and got nothing"
144711,"Its says you are still collecting data. You guys are sending mixed signals i am nut sure what to believe when its comes to privacy. I highly doubt that collected data wont just be wasted and not shared with anyone"
144729,"this didnt block any ads idk why i fully expected to be able to go on any website with ads and not see any but i still see them"
144932,"if only it had history and private tabs and download manager it would be greaaaat i used duckduck search engine for so long it's top."
144978,"Claims to not censor. I have searched controversial subjects where both sides of the argument were displayed. Awesome! Unfortunately now you search these subjects and they are very one-sided and biased. Too bad you guys have seem to sold out."
145094,"Not to bad, but fo not believe it keeps Google and other tracking or trackers from my information, sad the times we live in."
145112,"They dont listen for feedbacks on playstore hence 2 stars. No option to change default search provider."
145156,"Needs work but promises more privacy. Who really knows or trusts any claim anyway. Everythings a racket after all."
145216,"It's quite osm bt it needs some upgradation regarding large file download and faster internet surfing."
145242,"I want an overall dark mode like Samsung Internet Browser. Your browser do not have the ability to darken any web site."
145277,"Honestly i hate it all it does it replace google and annoy you it didnt even block trackers:/ not impressed"
145402,"Well, ...It is GREATLY appreciated to have the option to search without goo gle next to us....however,...How about a DuckDuckGo Gps navigation app?"
145448,"This Browser need some improvement Plz try to much better tell how to trust this Browser I can't download some videos 😡😡🤬"
145578,"At one time I'd have given five stars, sensoring bad vaccine info just shows duckduck has been compromised and towing the hidden agenda line!!! Now deleting!!!"
145773,"Not stable. Freezes often. Sometimes when you share the link to a page you are viewing via text and then close texting, the browser will close all of your links and revert back to the homepage. It's got some efficiency and error trapping issues in the coding. Also, if you close the browser and come back, it doesn't seem to be a way to view any of the pages that you had open. Clean Slate each time."
145806,"Decent nobody know§ if they can even achive privacy anymore applications are more advanced than yòur brain they can build a new reality more defined than the one u live currently also creating more paradoxs and places only perfection could barly grasp."
145830,"The app was suggested to me, and I do like the privacy factor and it is faster than Chrome. However, when I am scrolling (which I do a lot in web browsers), I have to be very careful or I cause the app to refresh the page! Then I lose my place and have to start over which as you can guess is too annoying so I have to give up completely. Please fix this."
145879,"Why don't apps tell you where the default file download location is? How is it not obvious that that is required information."
145883,"Download ecosia instead- it has similar elements but it also plants real life trees as you use the app."
145908,"Buggy and needs some redesigns on the UI. Every time I switch between tabs, it automatically selects the address bar and my keyboard pops up. Why? It should just go to the screen I'm viewing. "Open in background tab" launches the tabs in reverse order from every other browser. Selecting different tabs is way too sensitive and you can easy swipe to close the tab instead of selecting it. There's also no way to recover it. App crashes with lots of tabs open. By comparison I don't have the same crash issues with Firefox or Chrome. You should be able to change the multiple-tab view to list instead of gallery. If you get a pop-up tab, you can't hit the back button to get to your original screen--you have to hit the tabs button, close your new tab, and then swipe to return to the original one you were reading."
145913,"Hey DuckDuckGo. I've had a decent experience using your app, but there's a problem. Sometimes I will tap a link to a site, but it shows an error with no reason except, "connection refused". This has been happening especially often with links that go to hydroxychloroquine-related sites and studys. I pasted the failing link to my firefox browser...and it goes to the site. It was a completely safe site, too. No reason to block it. I'd continue to use this app if there was no suspicious censorship."
145949,"It's pretty good, it's like Firefox before they committed suicide with that latest psychotic update but can't access history or anything and it's inconvenient. If I accidentally close a tab it's gone forever. If I visit a site often it doesn't get easier. Not user friendly. Also very annoying is the fire symbol right at the top which asks you if you want to delete all your data and close all the tabs. And every time the split screen is adjusted the page reloads and it's incredibly annoying."
145964,"I used to be able to set it as a home page app but it's not letting me do it anymore, and I'm not sure why?"
145992,"I am going to have to remove 2 stars because, after going to great trouble to fix the color settings to my preferences, every time I exit, all the settings that I have carefully saved vanish. Also, you need to add a font like Gothic bold for older vision. The more customization features the better. It was very user-friendly and not a source of incessant annoyance."
146008,"I can not seem to share videos and articals on this app but it definitely seem uncensored compared to google and others I may just not be using it right and yet to figure out how to share articals"
146013,"The search engine is excellent, the browser is... passable. Can't print pages, can't override local certificate errors (have to use Chrome to access my router, which defeats the purpose of having a privacy browser.) Some websites open links in a different but not new tab, overwriting a tab I had opened previously to use later. Can't see whole screen on some websites and can't zoom out to see it. Chrome lets me zoom out. I don't want to ever use Chrome, but for some sites I have to."
146040,"I love that DuckDuckGo doesn't allow websites to track my every move and doesn't sell my information! However, it needs a lot of polishing. Frequently when I try to enter text, my keyboard won't appear unless I minimize and reopen the window. Recently websites will appear as an entirely white screen until I force close the app, then reopen. Last, when I type something into the widget words do not auto space. Fixing these bugs would result in a five star rating from me."
146071,"It was a great browser but now I can't, you know, BROWSE with it anymore. Search function is crippled by formatting errors that prevent input from being an option, and moving a map to search a new area just zooms back to the previous area. Not functional for web searches. I'm uninstalling this one now. I loved the mission but this isn't a path for me. I need a search engine I can functionally enter requests into."
146087,"Annoying popup messages about obvious features of the software made me uninstall this five minutes after trying it. Privacy isn't very useful if the software gets in the way of getting anything done. Didn't see a setting to disable the popups, but they really should give the option of getting rid of them without needing to dig through the settings."
146101,"Since last update, a number of issues present: 1.) Results of search field or web address entered do not load into a window/page. Have to select the dropdown menu, which shows the unloaded page as a tab, then select the tab in order to view the page. 2.) Scrolling down inadvertently engages a page reload; feature WAAAY too sensitive. 3.) Can not use the search field in YouTube more than once before having to close the page & opening again. Can not get cursor in search field to type anything!"
146108,"I have been using duckduckgo for more than a year and it had become my go-to browser for almost everything. However, after the recent updates the page loading times have become atrociously slow to the point that the app has literally become unusable. Also, it frequently crashes especially after loading multiple pages. Truly disappointed in letting go off such a once-upon-a-time wonderful app."
146142,"The latest update has a flaw for dark theme users. I activated the dark theme yet it changes back to white when I exit and reopen the app. Before the recent update, I never had that problem. The fact that I have to change my theme from white to dark everytime I open my app is really annoying. If you could fix this problem, I would be more than happy to change my review to 5 stars."
146144,"I really like the idea and implementation of this app! However, it saves downloaded files in .bin format. Changing the filename to .zip for instance doesn't help, it's still an unknown format. Nor can I find where in the settings to change this. Google is surprisingly of no assistance on this. Please help!"
146148,"CAN ONLY USE CLIPBOARD ONCE PER NEW BROWSER PAGE. STILL NO NIGHT MODE OPTION FOR WEB PAGES. DO THEY REALLY CARE/LISTEN ABOUT PEOPLES FEEDBACK? WHEN CLEARING ALL DATA AND OPENING NEW BROWSER PAGE I NOTICED ONE OF THE PREVIOUS WEB SEARCHES!!!??? WAS NOT DELETED. I DONT TRUST THE PRIVACY AND WOULD PREFER THE OPTION TO DELETE MY OWN DATA."
146234,"I have an LG K51 phone. When I completely shut down phone & restart, the app icon & shortcuts saved to my home screen, disappear. The app is still in the drawer, but not on the home screen. Shortcuts are gone for good. Bookmarks within app remain. EDIT: In settings, I'd chosen the purple icon. When reset to the standard red icon, the app icon, and home screen shortcuts remain after restart. I tested a few times. If purple, home screen app icon & shortcut disappear. Did not check other colors."
146237,"Was great on my old phone. I loved it. 5 stars. However when I purchased a newer upgraded version of my previous phone I got this app again and it doesn't work nearly as well. Takes forever to load a page if it even loads at all. Most of the the time it doesn't load, freezes and after about a minute or so of it not doing anything I get a notification saying that "duck duck go isn't responding: wait or close app" or something to that effect. I uninstalled it. I'll redownload when it works again."
146239,"I could gave it 5 stars but it don't show downloading section and also don't show doanloading size and howmuch downloaded"
146266,"Being a 'new' browser I have to admit I don't have enough basic software knowledge on how to adjust the settings to fit more functionally my needs having mostly to do with individual site cookies, settings, signing-in to Google accts.? I like the pop-up notice that what I do, and where I go is being blocked by DUCK-DUCK GO as to tracking. THAT seems to calm me down to not worry about my ineptitudes of what to do 'manually' for the POSITIVE that Chrome has done without prompt."
146295,"The recent update make this browser become worse, font size become smaller and if you also open another few tabs, some of them have normal size font. Often happen recently, the result from search become blank page and only visible if you reselect the tab and this problem never happen in 2 previous version. Old problem is still there, if you "add" multiple tabs and lets say you go to the address 1 by 1 from your bookmark, any not-connected yet tab will be deleted or overwrited by the current tab"
146310,"The browser needs refinement I would like it to store the sites I visit the most in tiles only for my own use until I burn the info. As well I would like to be able to add my own selected news feeds to the home page and private browsing tab separate from main history. Very much like opera mobile in layout. But I really do like the privacy and how responsive the browser is so far."
146311,"until it comes with an add blocker and redirect blocker it's just not really usable on many sites. Many sites I visit redirect to other pages with adds or give many virus popups and it's impossible to stay on the actual site I wanted to as a new page loads and then I can't even go back so the only option is to close the tab. There seems to be no way to block adds and redirects using this browser. But on the PC I can go on the same sites with all the adds and redirects blocked."
146329,"The UI has greatly improved... But still lacks few fundamental things like exit option, extension support irrespective of being based on Firefox.... Locations where Network is weak - the browser fails to load pages.... So there are few basic stuff that needs more attention. Updated review- The exit button has come. So thanks. Added a star. Bur page rendering is still weak. The spaces in a page where ads are blocked is visible. Looks wired. They needed to be hidden. Others do it. So can you."
146360,"Duck Go Search Engine did excellent on halting page trackers, 3 🌟. When Duck Go updated their system, it ate a lot of my data and gulped down battery power like a 10 yr long marooned sailor in the Bermuda Triangle! Yikes!! Unfortunately I had to uninstall until they can get bugs fixed. I am battery challenged and scrounging for xtra data to get research work done. : - /"
146361,"Used to love the app but having to reset your settings and viewing preferences every time you open the app is ridiculous and a pointless waste of time. Font size and theme should be saved by default. A dark mode options that extend to sites you visit is also long overdue. Firefox extension "Dark background light text" does it well. Not using the duck yuck go app anymore."
146368,"The worst browser to use to watch videos, especially when browsing Facebook. Once you play a video, the whole browser screen goes completely black. You'd be able to hear the sound of the video but can't see anything. Also happened on some other sites as well where I usually go to watch football highlights."
146418,"Just migrated from the hideous Firefox update. So far I like this browser, but I hate the homepage layout. I want to be able to set my homepage in setings, to the DDG site search page. This seems impossible. Am I missing something? Will you add this option? I just want a clean DDG search page like the website. Orherwise it's good. Fast and simple."
146422,"Updates messed up scrolling, if I overshoot something and try to scroll back up, it seems to lock up for a moment and reloads the page sending me back to the top... real annoying to find the same spot on longer pages. Please fix this. UPDATE, on top of above issue app would switch or close windows spontaneously...had to uninstall. If yours works, DO NOT INSTALL ANY UPDATE"
146425,"Too bad that you guys partnered with Yandex. Now I keep seeing Russian ads that I don't even understand and I don't know how this browser is any safer now because of this."
146427,"What dumb browser What's the point if no adblocker If can't block ads no privacy 🔏 Don't trust Open one movie site many ad pages attacks 👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎"
146435,"I used samsung browser, but after an update and constant pop up windows to put my Location on, I deleted it and got this just to try. At first I was pleased but over the last 2 weeks streaming and playing videos sends my phone into a flickering frenzy, I have to reboot my phone all the time the web pages crash rendering my phone useless, it was ok to start with, not now"
146450,"Overall-Great app for those who seek privacy in the Internet. However, it's not that convenient to use. The main thing that annoys me is inability of browser to close tabs automatically. Let me explain. You click a link and the browser opens it in the new tab. You read the material and then you want to get back to the previous tab. You click "back" and you get to the empty new tab + you need to search for the tab you came from (sometimes that tab is not the last one on the list). Pls, fix this!"
146483,"When viewing full images, there is a slide delay. That's pretty annoying. Also, please remove the wasted space around images for practical reasons. Some of us don't need "fancy" but we need something that lets us view as many images on the screen as possible. One last complaint, google chrome adds more relevant images below the current selected image, this is also an important feature. I wanted to move to a different browser and this is the best one that I could find - but it still is lacking."
146487,"If I am on 1 app and click on a link why can't duck duck take me to that web page instead of a web page about time zones either fix this please or I'm fine with this wannabe app"
146513,"initially I was very impressed, and promoted the app to others. eventually, gradually, the lure of paying destinations obviously started to skew the search results. filters were needed to avoid suggested shopping trips. other irritations were ignored and ultimately prompted me (and associates) to finally switch to Web based SwissCows, recommend. oh, for browsing; Ad Blocking - Not Tracking, Fast, BRAVE, great combo with SwissCows"
146550,"in my email account i am unable read my email. i can see address to but nothing else. there is no history saved but a data cleared option looks like its a decorative piece as users cant return to former pages. smh also as im searching i must key in my search multiple times just so it would locate my request. honestly as time goes so does every thing else. like all search engines just have some hiccup they refuse to inform the people. gosh i miss the 90's. mid 90's that is."
146553,"I've gave it 3 stars because as a privacy browser I believe it does what it says on the tin, the problem for me is that since updating it crashes A LOT (almost constantly), and sometimes things on the screen don't respond to being pressed. I've been using it a while now and these are recent issues that I'm noticing. Other browsers I use don't have this issue, so I can only conclude that the app's recent updates are the culprit."
146596,"Duckduckgo seems like a great privacy oriented alternative to other browsers, however, I'd really like to see a couple of options added in the settings menu: 1. Being able to have the address/navigation bar at the bottom of the screen so that I can reach it on my giant phone 🙂 2. Make the theme of the app follow the system's theme instead of having it manually set to either light or dark. There is probably more smaller features I'd like to see added for this to be my default browser."
146599,"As a user I would be able to enjoy using a solid browser without getting told I'm using a solid browser. Seems like a 5/5 otherwise, but push notifications and feedback prompts feel invasive. Will continue using the product, so I can recommend it to others; it still beats having to customize your normal browser."
146601,"I like that this is a private browser, however, the main issues I have is that it's extremely slow and won't load pages sometimes, even when my other browsers are working fine. Another thing that bugs me is that I use an android phone, and when I go to download images, it saves as an image file only compatible with Apple."
146604,"Can NOT handle important business, such as fill out applications...I had to use Google Chrome to apply for the service that I needed, for which was an instantaneous SUCCESS....I was blocked 10+ times in completing my application using DuckDuck Goose....A great many things CANNOT be done using this useless browser...USER BEWARE!!!!!! GOOGLE is by far the BEST BROWSER BAR NONE!!!!! THIS BROWSER WILL NEVER MEASURE UP!!!!!! LOSERS!!!!!!!! I'd much rather be tracked than to use this peice of GARBAGE!"
146608,"Absolutely horrible.Have to change safe settings with every use. For an adult user this is very frustrating and your still censored like a child of what you can or can not watch. Can not watch videos enlarged after having pushed the enlarge icon on the applicable video. Serch engine is very substandard very basic and highly controlled. Only positive it blocks tracing or so it says. "BING"is so out of date Total waste of time...Not recommended."
146616,"Good till recently.. separate company controls color you choose for icon. Privacy policy for that app says it gather's. and sells data. Therefore this is no longer a privacy app. Trying others. I notified them they are making http port 80 connections. No reply. NY Times and many other papers and cyberssec sites hook in to my replies. Good. That's the purpose. That's next. I have snapshots in other locales. 60 minutes is a bit late. Nice till you sold out. Like Firefox with TOR. Where's yours?"
146624,"This is good but it is just like google it uses www witch means that it is same as google and if you search up something a it has cookies you could delet it from google but i could not figur out how to in this browzer"
146641,"I like Duck on my laptop, so I wanted the app, too. Unfortunately, it has very poor accessibility - it defaults to a black keyboard with tiny thin white letters which are illegible with my sight condition and no option to change to my preferred 3rd party keyboard. I cannot use it and have to uninstall, which is a pity."
146651,"App is PRIMITIVE! Looks like as of some interns designed for hobby. Common guys we people want DDG to beat the Ggl, develop the app with finest UI. Chrome, Firefox, Brave all have very good UI, why not DDG?"
146662,"Makes safer and more private browsing easy on mobile, but not without problems. You can't see the full URL of links without opening them, and you have no control over what's blocked, which means you can't whitelist as needed, e.g. to get media to display properly on certain sites. I'm a huge fan of DuckDuckGo's philosophy, but their search engine and browser still have a ways to go before they can replace their tracker-laden counterparts."
146673,"The app needs some work. When I'm on Facebook, videos tend to not display properly or just go all crazy and give me a black flickering screen until I scroll past the video. The ability to go to a previous page definitely needs to be worked on. When I close the app or open a new link in duckduckgo, I cannot go to the previous page in the other open windows/tabs on Android. Other than this, app seems to work well."
146696,"Many more options for themes, colors, moderation, tools, etc. than Google. It gives you a grade of how safe a site is, shows how many sites it blocked from your personal info, and percentage showing which sites do the most tracking. It's secluded, easily navigated, and pretty. However, when I try to go on some sites (Reddit, Tumblr, etc.), the app just kicks me out. It also doesn't have as many widgets as Google, so you have to run around a bit to find something."
146702,"Good but after a few searches and watching some videos the videos will ether flash, faces will turn blue and freeze, glitch out, video will just appear blank, I don't know why this is I tryed on several devices but still same effect it could just be a thing with videos and html I don't know but I hope it's fixed soon."
146722,"The app gives the indication that it's blocking traces but it could use some more work with how it changes the looks and functionality of the apps I use constantly. There's a noticeable difference. But I guess the tradeoff is acceptable. Happy with the app so far."
146730,"I have been using it for a couple of months looking for a more secure browser. I like that it shows request blocks, but it has become fairly irritating that I can't download PDFs successfully. I haven't tried to figure out if it's some setting not configured by default, but downloading files is pretty basic and should just work immediately."
146763,"Great free browser, until the latest update. Now it takes so long to load a page (any page) that they time out 50% of the time, or only manage to load a text version (it feels so 2002!). Struggling with it now and thinking of reverting back to Firefox. Also bookmarks - make them sortable!!!! Dropping the new links on the bottom of the list just deters you from having many as searching for the one you want from a long random list is painful! at the very least go alphabetical!!"
146766,"I love the privacy but I think im missing something. Hitting the back button on my phone usually goes back to the last page i was on, but sometimes it just closes the app completely, when i open the app back up its back to the home page and I cant find a way to get back to the last page i was on."
146774,"I would rate this browser higher, but it lack some essential basics which prevents me from using this as my main (or only) browser. It needs an "accessibility" section in settings where we could adjust the font/display size, it needs a homepage or "speed dial" where we can quickly access our most used/visited bookmarks/websites, and it needs the feature to hide the status bar, an absolute must for all phones with amoled screens."
146779,"It's just like google highly sensored . You can surch what ever they want you to find. Its not a surch engine anymore its a propaganda engine."
146796,"It hangs.Most of the time while going back to the previous page(still opened) it shows a blurred or totally blank page, that you do not have any option to manage it because toolbar or setting icon and new tab opening icon is too disappeared. Thus you have the only option to close the browser and finish the entire ongoing task or session and You will need a fresh start. So harassing.."
146804,"It had let me go to websites and stuff but i use to use this one website that google warned me about, i went in anyway nothing was stolen (dumb luck) but just incase i always signed out of my google account when using it, I downloaded this app went to the same exact website and it wouldnt load, i have great internet while all the websites that used to warn me. Wouldnt load at. all."
146811,"Same issues I have with Google. Do a search on white couples and you get photos of mixed couples Do a search on black couples and you get black couples. Do a search on straight couples and you get gay and straight couples. Do a search on gay couples and you get gay couples. HOW IS THIS NOT MESSING WITH THE. SEARCH"
146828,"Worst app i ever seen because it created difficult in downloading if you try to back from app then download are automatically stop"
146835,"Browser is good. Everything is ok. But if you want to download around 1gb or more size file than you should not go for it. Its downloads files via android download manager. The files would be shifted to Download Manager. Many times it stops, unable to complete full download. It has not it's own download feature. Its totally depends on Download Manager."
146840,"Latest update (Sept): 1) app is broken. Searches don't load. Blank screen. You have to go into a menu and then back out of it in order to see the page. 2) now downloads images as .bin files?! Completely useless - can't be shared on social media apps or edited, etc."
146877,"Android 7.1. About 1/3 of the time, the browser loads 3/4 of the website, then freezes progress followed by freezing the entire app. Selecting report takes you to an unrelated Google site, not to DDGo support. Does not send system snapshot so they can figure out what's wrong. 2 to 1 star. No action in 3 months."
146879,"Used to love this app, but I hate the new interface updates. Why is there no setting to change the list of tabs back into a 'list view' like the old versions instead of the stupid thumbnails? Why is there no option to disable the annoying word-bubble pop-up things ("I blocked this for you, high five!"), for those that just want the app to shut up and let us browse? Certain parts of this update are good, but rolling out bad interface changes with no option to revert them is just bad form..."
146885,"My experience with Duck Duck Go is limited as yet. Worth sticking with (for its security features as far I understand and trust). Hoping that the App will improve on some features. For example when accessing FB desktop, there is no zoom-in feature. Also, pop up notifications appear when trying to access messages which cannot be read as they are over magnified with no zoom-out option. What is good, is that using backspace at this point does make messages accessible."
146898,"It's a great little browser with a light system footprint but there's no option to save login info. Security issue or not, that's an essential feature I need because of all my accounts with many passwords. I love the black and white dark theme and the ability to save images from searches (glaring angerly at firefox for omitting that). But, unfortunately I have to uninstall DDG because of the lack of a login feature. Super disappointing!"
146946,"There's a lag I've been facing lately, whenever I want to search something on a website keyboard doesn't appear. (It works for the first time but doesn't afterward). You'll have to refresh the whole page just to make it work again. Hope they fix this soon."
146948,"Seems 2B good software but the sites should have to ask permisn to shuffle or trade out the page your looking at while in idle, because I had left the multiple window panel open last night or the night before, and I picked up my phone again which I barely ever use, and it had a page displayed that I did not search for!!! Am I becoming outdated on the way the servers let sites do page shuffling now??? Or is this software, the site, or the people I trust with my passcode being janky or crooked??"
146981,"Great browser but now after the last update i experience a weird bug. Everytime i open a new toolbar and type something into the search bar, the page appears to be blank unless i open settings menu and come back to the toolbar. Then everything is shown as it should. I've tried rebooting, clearing cache and even reinstalling the app. The problem still lingers on and it's annoying."
146992,"App has some bugs that they need to sort out. Sometimes my keyboard won't pop up if i click the search bar. That hasn't happened with any other browser. Also for some annoying reason even though i save the dark mode it always switches to light mode when i kill the app from the background and open it again after. Other than that their interface needs polishing and upgrading. The side bar is clunky and feels like its from 2007. Other than that this app is pretty awesome"
146996,"Unfortunately as much as I like DuckDuckGo this browser is terrible. There are no settings for anything. Seriously, nothing for homepage, tabs, bookmarks, etc. It's even worse than the new Firefox Daylight, and I thought nothing could be worse than that."
147020,"Edit.It used to be the absolute best browser. But the last few months its been some really annoying problem. When i open a new tab to look at a recipe or a picture or anything and then i close the tab and want to go back to the page i had open but its all white stays so for several minutes and sometimes it goes back to the page but most times it either go back to start of this app or it goes back to my home screen. Its extremely annoying especially when there isn't history and open tab that way"
147032,"This app closes every page that I open after I hit the back button and after I minimize to switch to a different task with no way to recover the page. It takes me to the blank home screen with the logo in the center then displays a blacked out tab where the page used to be when I open the tabs button. EXTREMELY frustrating. Ive lost too many references for my research due to this. I will not be using this app anymore, as its cost me more time and effort than contributing towards productivity."
147046,"I like the idea behind this browser..BUT the app has developed a really irritating feature, once you have 3+ pages open you have roughly a 80% chance of it just giving up trying to load the page. Not just the new window all windows, it basically gives up. The only fix is to shut down and restart DDG which looses all the windows you had open."
147047,"Decent but has a long way to go. Mobile is app tomes out. Search engine still needs a great deal of work. Not as flexible as G with keywords. Desktop verion is a little better on searches but maps default to Bing, which is abysmal. Hopefully DDG will get better with time."
147058,"Im only gonna give it a 3 star for now due to some times when im scrolling a website or something the screen just blacks out and i need to scroll up and down for a sec to make everything come back but otherwise it fast and snappy but the home screen search widget might need some work as it sometimes takes 10ish seconds to load and allow me to search but once again its mostly seamless"
147066,"I wanted to like this browser. Really, I did. I like DDG's search engine, and there's plenty I like about this app, such as the way the private browsing works. But, well, when I go to a website, I prefer it TO ACTUALLY F***ING LOAD. Call me fussy, but sitting watching a blue progress bar sit motionless at 50% for MINUTES doesn't strike me as the browsing experience I expected for 20 years into the 21st century. We don't have flying cars yet, but SURELY we can have functioning browsers."
147078,"I was really excited about this until I found I couldn't import any of my bookmarks....I understand it's just a search engine, but I've already saved previous searches, too many to do 1x1 again. I'll be looking forward to the update. Until then, sadly, I'm going to have to use convince over security."
147092,"Even though privacy feature are being provided whats the use of your browser if it cant load a single search ever. I mean it takes forever for any search to work!!! And this problem has been since longest time I've come to know this app. Dissapointing & stupid!! Fix it."
147101,"Don't like the bottom interface, it ruins the flow having to scroll up to either get bookmarks or burn it to the ground, because keyboard or android main buttons aways obscure it. I liked your earlier builds that had a drop or swipe menu. Lg stylio 5 user. Plus when you open a new session it auto opened the keyboard, so several clicks later and a swipe i get to the bookmark i wanted."
147113,"I'm a old user of duckduckgo . it was a best privacy browser in play store but Now a days the app is unable to load a normal website. It's to slow for loading pages . And sometimes it's took too much time for loading pages and at last it shows that webpage is not available.."
147119,"Hey, NO matter how much privacy you give its the ease of use that always wins........ i cannot navigate forward and backward through the web pages ........by swiping frwd & backward & also cannot switch between multiple tabs through swiping gestures on url tab....... The microsoft edge browser has these abilities, which is made of the same chromium and similar UI as this app. Please do include them in the next update. Please...!!!"
147123,"- Clear tabs and data on exit doesn't work. You have to click the fire thing manually. If you exit the app and open it again the last page you were on reopens. - Changing the app icon breaks the app. Nothing happens when you click the icon so there's no way to open the app unless you uninstall and reinstall it. Edit: restarting phone fixes this issue"
147168,"This app was once legit on its claims of privacy and respecting user data. I am 100% convinced it listens to you and tries to auto fill from phrases it picks up around the room thru the mic. I recently have noticed TWO billboards for DuckDuckGo pop up on my commute to work in the last 6 months. This was exactly when the data mining seemed to begin. Go with someone else because this app is just another Chrome at this point."
147176,"Fine on day1, but now on day 2 I get choppy audio on Youtube playback. Battery was drained while asleep too. Not looking good DDGo. Reboot did not improve. Reinstall neither. Battery drain is about 5x what firefox was consuming with same top quality home wifi signal. Sad to say, total fail ddg!"
147177,"Swipe down to refresh the page is a good feature but not when you have zero control over it. It picks up the refresh swipe from anywhere on the page and oftentimes results in me reloading a page I've been trying to read. The app is completely unusable in this state"
147194,""New Tab" doesn't work on my tablet. Other browsers that have a New Tab option actually open a new browser tab. DDG just clears previous data and goes to new site. There is never more than one tab open. If a new tab can't be opened, then please remove that from the Options. Samsung Galaxy Tab A 10.1, 2019 version)"
147240,"The app has built in popups during browsing from duckduckgo that can't be ignored to use/proceed. I don't want to be tracked - that's a main point of using your browser - to be anonymous.. Absolute feedback should NEVER be mandatory to use your product! FYI- there are other browsers out there that claim to be anonymous."
147245,"If I'm on the web or images every time I want to go back one page it always takes me back to the main page and I have to reenter what im looking for again. Plus on the main page I have to search web before I can pick another category, would be nice to have these options on the main page. Other than that I like it."
147247,"The dark theme isn't working correctly, I can't keep it after deleting tabs and data as I was used to; I need to constantly change it after I've deleted the tabs and data with the fire icon. The dark theme is the reason why I switched from Chrome and security please fix it, I love Ducky <3."
147254,"A very good light, fast, secure browser. Automatically turns on the incognito mode of SwiftKey. I hope it stays as minimalistic as it is. There are two areas that need improvement: - Bookmarks UI - needs to be improved. Please provide option for sorting and add bookmark folders. - When screen brightness changes due to ambient light conditions, the display turns off, while YouTube video is playing."
147270,"App started opening OK, but after a few minutes it went to an online slot gambling site. I was not able to get off it, even after clearing it off and starting over. Couldn't use the app. Tried again a couple of hours later and the slot game popped up as soon as I clicked on the Duck Duck Go site."
147275,"this site ment to stop tracking. so why do you have the fireproof Webpage that allows tracking sites ie: facebook etc cookies to be saved after the tabs n data is cleared? surely if I proof a site and clear tabs n data and it saves that site and not clear the cookies it is tracking me , that it the point of book marks to save the site not the cookies if I proof a page and sign out I still have to remember passwords I would rather a save password so I don't have to remember several passwords."
147276,"The results you get are just as biased as Google, taking you to the results the establishment wants you to see, and away of everything they don't want you to see, specially anything too close to the actual truth, even science. Results are clearly intended to shape or influence people's opinions and thoughts, adhering full on with progressive agenda, when the majority would like to be able to think for themselves, not told what to say or even think. Why not have a neutral algorithm? Disgusting."
147286,"Tried to ID mystery icons; found help/ instructions do not exist; or hidden within privacy boasting "about" pages, etc. Too much fluff, not enough dirrection. Poor support at other companies isnt a good excuse to follow suit. The intro help wizard is never enough; communties fail (I wont sign up to another site anyhow)... INDEXING: proven for hundreds of years to work well. other device hates it 8/25/20 I'll still use DDG engine, but in another, working, browser..... Uninstalling 7/11/20"
147296,"I've used the DuckDuckGo browser on my desktop for a while, but I am new to the cellphone browser. So far it is working well, but I feel I have to learn more about the settings, what they mean, what is the result of the setting, and such. So far so good."
147301,"Incredibly annoying app. Pressing back 2 times closes the entire damn tab with no way to reopen no history, scrolling long pages with images randomly jumps up and i keep scolling past the same image 5 times, the burn button is a constant threath next to the tab button that u have to be weary of."
147337,"One, this app is great, but: 1. It doesn't show sample text of the best March at the top like chrome does. 2. It keeps opening new links on new tabs. Is that really necessary? Thanks for the hard work."
147356,"DDG is my search engine of choice and I REALLY want to like this browser, too, but it just can't compete with Firefox, fitted with uMatrix. My gauge is EFF's Panopticlick, and this browser does not prevent fingerprinting at all. Without extensions in general, it's not customizable in the ways that matter to me."
147365,"Love the intent of the app. Needs an easy bookmark button and refresh. Would give another 4 stars, but it keeps freezing and crashing. On Verizon Ellipsis tablet. UPDATE : 7/27/20, I've updated this app several times this year. IT'S CRASHING CONTINUALLY NOW. I am thinking updating it made it way worse. CAN'T EVEN USE IT, and I loved it so... 😟"
147369,"So many verification problems. You verify, succeed, wants you to sign in, asks you to verify, you do so successfully, then it asks you to sign in again, then it asks you to verify.....ad infinitum. Damned annoying and ruins my browsing."
147400,"So, unlike every other browser in the world, tapping "back" exits the browser rather than closing the current tab to return focus to the parent tab? ... And there's no setting to change this? ... Unfortunately I cannot afford the time necessary to reprogram my reflexes just because you cannot program a browser."
147406,"Although i feel safer and secure.....I cannot do certain things like Video calls ( Zoom, Skype etc) ....Duck Duck Go is protecting me yes but it is not allowing me to hear sounds/ audio...during Video calls esp Zoom. I have to download Google Chrome for that. Secondly if i am searching for stuff on the net i also have to resort to Google. Is it because the monopoly of Google trascends all here?"
147465,"DuckDuckGo is legit and it helps a lot to protect my privacy because you know I don't want to get tracked out of somebody because I search something like that. But I visit YouTube and play the video I want but when I play the screen is stuck and sometimes the video becomes shaken inside the screen and it can't move the images but the timer still plays."
147471,"Edit 3: Removed 1 star for 1. Not being able to block video auto-play on many websites. 2. Not fixing the "Desktop site" issue But good job in adding pulldown to refresh, per my request Why am I seeing "suggestions" that is not in English?"
147478,"It's actually a great browser and the most important thing is that it's safe, but the three star because it sometimes stops working and crashes, also the cloud saved settings always gets removed and switches to default settings."
147487,"I just started using this app and I was disappointed that I couldn't search things easily eBay was not opening up and it was telling me that it was invalid. I was searching on Google to find a picture of president Clinton holding a Bible in front of the church the only thing that would come up on Google was stuff about president trump and what he did in holding The Bible Nothing would come up showing Clinton. As soon as I put the same search in Your search picture immediately came. Hmm?"
147495,"Thank you for Ducky! Fast and reliable, BUT it always fails to download PDF-format files. I don't know if the same thing goes for other formats. Please, fix! Problem number two: Ads from websites, pop-ups that do not get blocked by the browser."
147520,"Does this app ever stop talking? Is this a app for idiots or who thought you have to tell people how to search for something? And where are the freaking settings? What you can access from within the app is pittyfull... Screw you, you are not even worth the electricity to store your data."
147537,"Not proceeding with this September update. You provide the option of granting location access to websites. Why would I do that when the whole idea behind your browser is supposed to be privacy? Seems sketchy. Auto updates are now off."
147539,"At first it was a good app with promising privacy.....but after a post in GitHub saying it takes your data in Mobile browser I had stopped using the browser but still continuing it in other browser like Firefox.I would recommend you to use the Duck Duck Go search engine in other browser rather than it's browser or use other search engine like start page etc."
147550,"New update locks up and has "stopped working" over and over. Will try to uninstall and reinstall but is useless since the "update." Update: Resored my tablet to factory settngs erasing all data. Downloaded DuckDuckGo. Absolutly useless. Youtube inoperable, history channel videos inoperable. Get to work Duck staff!!!"
147572,"Not working anymore, after several years of being just fine. Left feedback in the app, sent emails to the developer, no response. Duck Duck Go has Gone Gone Gone. I guess they're on to something new now."
147602,"Changed to 1 star. It's no better than Google. Search results lean extremely left! Very bias results. Even when making specific searches, it still filters anti Trump, pro left garbage, that has nothing to do with the specified search! Hell, even a search for weather brings political results. just like Google..."
147611,"JUST OK- because Browser settings "open extra links", is STUCK on "Yes, open links", and is GRAYED OUT, so I CANNOT choose "No, do Not open extra links" - I do like this browser, but major security issue/wide open for hackers????- Maybe it is My device? or google accounts ? because I do have hackers....!"
147620,"WAS a good app, but now when you do a search, it comes up with a blank page. Very annoying to have to refresh every time you search.Some of my favorites will no longer open, page comes white and blank. Uninstalled."
147640,"Not a viable and usable browser if I can't import Bookmarks. Password managers do not work on DuckDuckGo. No way to import favorites. Does not have extensions for ad blocks, https everywhere. I'm really not sure how secure this browser."
147642,"I don't like the way your application works. I can't turn off the stupid bot that gives you messages while using the search engine. It's very annoying. Also, I don't like being forced to putting it as the main search engine for my phone. I would like to choose for myself if I want to use it."
147643,"Constantly freezes on android smartphone. Blue loading bar stops midway and nothing happens after that. Clear cache and force stop app to get it working again for a while. But issue returns. Just recently YouTube videos don't play properly, everyone in vids looks like a blue smurf. Wouldn't recommend ."
147651,"The app is junk, I've been having issues of typing in a search and the screen is blank, I contacted duck duck go and asked them and I never got anything back, it worked flawlessly until one of the updates."
147657,"I know disliking pull to refresh is unpopular or whatever but I like working from my phone as it's just more convenient for me. Sadly, having my information constantly disappearing because I accidentally scrolled to far up is just not something I can not deal with anymore."
147664,"It needs to be more convenient. Switching between the tabs and a separate download section are a must. The downloading seems to be happening nowhere. It is extremely difficult to locate downloads. Rest for the endeavor of protecting our privacy, kudos!"
147670,"Really disappointed. Can't increase text scaling/size. There are very few options in settings. Privacy is good though, but that shouldn't be the only thing if it's an app not a website."
147676,"I love the privacy, no ads, non-tracking, and quick option to instantly delete history, but whenever you want to look up a company, it will never give you the company website link, number, address, etc. Like Google, just articles written about that company."
147677,"The browser experience is good, but can you guys please improve the browsing speed in this one....as many websites are loading slow comparatively with Chrome and Firefox, and sometimes I get ads in other apps based on what I surf in this one....does'nt that mean that it isn't blocking the trackers completely?"
147688,"Since a few weeks the entire screen sometimes goes black when trying to watch video's/movies, when scrolling down the screen will become normal again (the website will be visible again) when the video comes into screen again it turns black again. It would be amazing if there was an option to customize the order of bookmarks."
147712,"DuckDuckGo promises a method to sanitize hour surfing history I can find no way on DuckDuckGo to do that so I'm a little disappointed"
147731,"Add blocker is just trash, I have just used Brave Browser it is very running smooth and has powerful add blocker, it really block adds. I would be happy if you could improve your add blocker and overall app to run smoother."
147736,"I APPRECIATE the privacy of this app but the search ability needs work... !! I have read about plenty of confusion about MISSING DOWNLOADS. If you open your file manager you SHOJLD find a folder named "Pictures", you should find your downloaded images in it."
147745,"Deleted almost immediately. it was blocking ads for certain. but it also stopped the basic functionality of the website I was trying to view. everything was blocked even though most of the content wasn't ads"
147746,"It maybe my wifi network but I have more difficulty connecting & staying connected to things since I installed this. It might protect me but not actually accessing a thing is wrong, if i wanted that I just wouldn't need this or the internet."
147757,"Why is the word Google written on the spacebar now? Does the app use Google's search engine? How can I choose which search engine to use?"
147763,"Has anyone noticed that location is now apart of the permissions with this app?? Part of the reason i use duck duck go is because it was different than chrome! Also, no back button. Very frustrating to use the back button on the phone and loose my search or page."
147783,"giving it another go hope it doesn't fail after a few days this time unfortunately there's no way to stop it clearing search data meaning each time i open the app i have to search websites TWICE to get there.i prefer to open browsers and have list of sites I've already visited...not start from scratch... its good for blocking ads on YouTube website tho, will ad more stars...maybe? USELESS APP deleted"
147789,"Just doesn't work the way it should. Doesn't deliver results as far as images, videos, even if you type that into the search box along with what ever you're searching. Should have an option for JUST image search or JUST videos. Doesn't seem to have near as many results or content to search from. Functionality or anonymity, take your pick I guess, can't have your cake and eat it too....."
147806,"Used to love this browser but each update is making it worse. Webpages crash a lot, Facebook in particular. Screen often goes black, then renders in again, then goes black again as you scroll up and down. Trying to play videos seems to be a trigger."
147812,"Freezing up lately 9.9.2020 Update (2 Stars rating) Still freezes up and freezes my phone. I even updated the new update yet I still have the same issue. It gets Stuck when I'm opening the app. I am unable to use this app."
147824,"Great but... If you click on a link, and get redacted to DuckDuckGo, 9/10 times it won't load, open, or will be blank. Other than this, it is a useful app and works well."
147825,"What is the point of a privacy based browser when you can't even block ads? Yes I know about Blokada and adguard dns but still there should be an in browser Adblock for the people who aren't as phone savvy. It's ridiculous. And the ads are sometimes terrible."
147828,"I really want to use this browser, but I literally can't. It's impossible to get anything to load, it always ends up freezing. Idk if it's just my phone, but i don't have any problems with chrome, so idk."
147847,"Its OK. If you search, and click a topic, then go back to search results, it takes you back to main duckduckgo page. So you have to search again. I'll keep ddg for the searches that I need real info, not filtered like Google. But for general info, I'll stick with Google. Unfortunately. Hopefully ddg improves"
147861,"It's still a great privacy app, but updates have a glitch. During search, the screen goes blank and you have to click on the pages layout then back to the page."
147867,"Oh look, yet another "privacy respecting" gimmicky garbage browser that will never catch on to the general population. May I add that it has no actual evidence of it hiding your data, especially with recent concerns emerging over this browser. Sad to think a lot of people will use this anyway thinking their personal information is safe just because they're told so."
147877,"This is a great but don't show third party tracker. Ads blocker not show. Download movie but third party app download show is the bad duck duck go. Privacy settings not available option. Updats featured. Give one star. Update features."
147891,"When scrolling or playing a video the browser would just go blank. Sometimes just flashing black and white, not sure why. It happens almost as if randomly. The only solution I know to fix this is refreshing the page, sometimes twice."
147921,"Whatever happened to "we don't sell user data", & "we don't track users and offer ads based on their activities". The only difference is we don't get to access our own search history using this search engine, while you as a company keep all our records and profit off of it. Scam"
147931,"This is FAKE privacy: e.g. will show 15 trackers blocked but when you toggle slider Off, DDG shows 45 trackers. So 30 trackers are still in place! See plenty of "ads placed by DDG", as well as popover ads with bogus privacy slider enabled. Several sites report DDG as "Chrome mobile"!! The majority of these 5 star reviews must be fake or ppl are unaware of the false premises of DDG."
147935,"I would give it 5 stars.. absolutely! But!!... Searching for adult content in "Videos Search".. (porn), and only getting YouTube even with safe search off is just plain stupid, annoying, a let down and disappointing.. This search criteria is best found in Google and unmatched by the heavyweight compared to DuckDuckGo"
147949,"This used to be a great app until the recent update. Now videos won't play/display and pages constantly freeze or don't load at all. I've been a loyal DDG user for a long time but am now downgrading my review from 4 stars to 1 star. Very disappointing."
147954,"Its good overall but I have some problems. Sometimes when I click on a tab (not on the x) the tab goes away making me lose everything I did on it. I wish there was an option to bring back that tab right after it deletes in case something like this occured. Sometimes when I reload it pauses in the middle of it and stays like this for an incredibly long time (im connected to my wifi btw). Also I would like to be able to move the tabs in the order you would like them so its easier to control."
147966,"I had to verify my email through a link. It wouldnt let me and then I couldnt clear it out of the search bar. I liked the idea of the privacy, but too much of a pain to use."
147970,"When I installed it whenever I open YouTube sometimes it would kind of bug out and it would make it so I couldn't access my phone for a bit and I'm thinking DuckDuckGo it kind of helps you back but also doesn't help and I also think that it's putting viruses on my phone so I don't really feel safe"
148013,"It's probably really good, but it just doesn't allow me to log into any sites I use. Also, despite the fact I have it set to UK, when I search it just comes up with things as if I've got it set USA. It's pretty much useless to me sorry."
148018,"I opened the app this morning and it was on Amazon. This would not normally be seen as a problem, however, I had not been on Amazon in days and the last time I used the app I cleared the history. You cannot convince me that they are not keeping tabs on your browsing history just like Google. This is an additional comment and the reason I have now uninstalled the app. Did a search on Google then changed to DDG, the Google search page came up with header and all when I opened the app. Not good."
148030,"Never in my whole life I've hated anything like I'm hating this stupid browser. It continuously stops loading the pages and I need to close it and open it again, extremely frustrating. It also doesn't remember the origin of a page after restarting, which means that if it freezes and I restart it, and it opens on the last seen page, when I try to go back it goes blank. And there is no chronology, which means, if by mistake I close a tab, I can't find it again. Whoever designed this is a loser..."
148035,"Just not ad powerful as Google. But you can't have it both ways. Google chases users all across the web, SAD!"
148045,"It doesn't block ads in videos and the UI is sometime confusing. Like 0 tabs open and you need to back to menu for open a new tab and then select it. Don't allow print in PDF or save pages too."
148050,"Tried it to get less preprogrammed indoctrination than google. But seems no different. All covid propaganda in searches. It seems no matter where or what you search covid lies rule supreme. Trying to find a church that didnt close down in fear. All i get is propaganda here and on google. Lucy lord of the air controls all internet."
148051,"Latest update downloaded 18th of August, still broken. New tabs load (progress bar completes) but page is blank/white, have to press the tab button at the top and go select the same page for content to appear."
148052,"worked fine for maybe a month besides glitches here or there but now it won't open anything. it all shows up as web page unavailable, i even tried re installing the app and it still won't work."
148067,"What the hell happened to downloads? With this last update, I can't download anything without needing to restart my device. Also, I can't click "View file" anymore because the bottom part of the app is covered by the Home-Back bar of my phone."
148073,"It's a good browser, but I can't make it my goto browser until you give it an import bookmarks feature. When's that going to happen? Until then Google chrome will still be my goto."
148088,"You can't install an ad blocker like Firefox. The desktop site button doesn't work. You can't rearrange tabs. And you can't change where it saves downloads. Edit: 3 months, none of these fixed."
148092,"I liked using it. And agree with it philosophically. But the browser freezes frequently and the only way i can get pages to load is to close the app and relaunch. Will look elsewhere until this is fixed."
148093,"There is no real way to know if this is legit and I don't like the fact that it is on Google Play Store. Run by Google! Why?? I would give 5 stars if I had proof I'm not being fooled by Google on this. I only have your word. Google is not honest. 🙄 Please prove me wrong. No response after all this time has passed? Why is it when I'm not using Chrome nor Facebook app (turned off) Facebook is still collecting when & where I'm logging in at through Chrome? Please reply."
148105,"Not happy. After logging onto my MyGov account, I couldn't log out due to the scroll bar on the menu not working. The page scrolled instead of the menu bar. I had to login through another browser to log back out. This is absolute rubbish. The last thing anyone needs is not to be able to log out of their accounts. I would not trust this for anything more than browsing."
148106,"This app does not do what it says. I've gotten more spam and bullsh** since I've used this than any other time in the past 20 years. It definitely is not worth anything. I've deleted it cause getting their customer service is like waiting on my third set of teeth. I definitely will not recommend this"
148107,"Although I've tried to work with this App for a long time, because I thought it would eventually live up to the hype. I've found it lacking, and highly hackable. Any little thing, like ordinary internet problems & Online interferences just overwhelm it to the point of incapacity. I'm afraid its back to the drawing board for this one. It's too frail, and doesnt live up to the hype."
148114,"Recently added all these popup overlays (that are distracting and interruptive), and useless notifications. If someone has DDG installed they're well aware of what it does. Please remove all the interruptions."
148118,"Seems more and more sites are growing wise to DDG and block content either by blacking it out or just plain refusing access and apparently the developers are gonna roll over and play dead without addressing this issue or attempting to fix it. It's too bad, because they Duck-Duck-Go browser seemed so promising."
148173,"It's OK for now.... definitely needs some improvements and bug fixes for certain aspects in searching pages... overall review is good for people who want like variety and options for the people 👏"
148175,"Well so far started off great, now it seems luike nothing is happening and it keeps cutting my wifi off"
148177,"The browser and search engine is working flawlessly without any ads. But the hardest thing is the downloaded file, i cant locate or save it to a certain location. Fix this and i will give five stars."
148220,"there is a problem in the app, when i put my settings and close the app, all of my settings return to default I try to save my settings but same problem happen update: now even with the update the same problem happens the app won't save my settings Update: same problem happened again it won't save my settings please fix the problem"
148226,"Great browser, however in my experience if two videos play simultaneously on a webpage, the page gets glitchy. Scrolling over them solves the issue. (Otherwise would be 5 star.)"
148233,"Until the browser has an option to cast to screen on what ever You're watching i won't use. I cast everything to my tv.TV. has anyone been able to cast anything from this browser to tv? Please let me what am doin wrong TY🙏🙏🙏"
148237,"Initially it was fast and seemed good. Now the web page flickers like lightening with no information shown. With little download size it is handy if the above problem is solved."
148238,"Sucks and frustrating. You won't find anything in a search that you're looking for unless you specifically put in the exact keywords so if you're trying to find information that you're not sure of good luck finding it using duck duck go. Really don't know what's more frustrating, having to choose predictive browser that is spying on you or a stupid browser that doesn't find you the information you're looking for, and yet can't get the experience that I'm looking for out of my technology."
148248,"Incompatible with a lot of websites. I really wanted to like this app and I did at first. I had so many issues that I ended up having to switch browsers to Firefox. at the point where you're having to switch browsers to download something or utilize a website you might as well go to the browser that lets you do what you need to do... As another issue, the search function was terrible."
148258,"The duck is annoying as [word that rhymes with duck], but the browser is actually okayish. Desperately needs better bookmark management. Wish the tab switcher were at the bottom. Reaching is nasty UX."
148261,"Love this app and have used it for awhile with no issues until the last few days. It keeps crashing and showing black screens after a page loads fine. Very frustrating, hopefully it'll be fixed soon!"
148274,"It would surely be nice if there was an adblocker in this so u could go to mangapanda or yify and not be attacked"
148277,"Not nearly as user friendly as Google. Always pulls up the last thing you searched, so you have to delete that before you search. Predictive text doesn't add a space automatically (hey, google does) and it FEELS like a second tier app."
148287,"Watching YouTube makes the browser flash uncontrollably. It also makes the keyboard unaccessible. This broswer has extremely poor search results. The massive inconvenience is not worth it."
148295,"The app isnt that good AT ALL it has no exstensions or any other things for cool themes and the privacy is pretty good but little to no custimization i would just use other browsers over this, google chrome,firefox,and opera"
148298,"Sites are able to access my exact location and what type of device I have. Without logging into Youtube, the suggested videos are the same videos that my account would have suggested to it. I have tested these before and after using the "Burn" function."
148304,"I don't what's happening with this app now-a-days it just stuck at one page , you can't search, you can't open sites and you can't even scroll in the website you are in It's happening to me many times from many days So I had to switch browser Fix those issues immediately"
148305,"+200mb & increasing not sure why no tab opened. Fortunately, there is an option to clear data within the app. Top privacy. Some basic gestures not working like swiping down to update the page, right left to move from the page ."
148334,"When ever im browsing Twitter pages or any other site with videos the whole screen turns black and glitches like it can't handle it or something. It doesn't do this when I search with other browsers plz fix cuz i really enjoy DDG."
148337,"It's DDG and a browser, which works fine and hopefully private, but don't know how to check that. One thing i hate though; going back in a "open link in new tab" tab, doesn't close the tab, but goes back to the homescreen. Which is awfull! I use this a lot to quickly read a page and go back to where i left off without reloading. So for me unusable atm."
148338,"After the 13 Aug 2020 update, pages have been failing to load about 90-95% of the time. Hope this gets fixed soon... Updated 18 Aug 2020. Issue persists."
148345,"Feedback link takes you to Webster's dictionary. What's up with that? Also, I would like to be able to use voice to text when searching, but it is disabled. Is there any way to use voice to text when searching? Uninstalled."
148366,"Killed my battery daily, I wanted to love this app, Inhad been using it daily but after downloading it my battery started to die quickly. Checking the stats on the phone showed the app was running all the time. I used to be able to go an entire day without charging my phone, but cannot do it with the app on my phone. I am using a new Samsung S-10."
148369,"HATE this upgraded app. Switching to a different mobile browser, after being 10+ year user. Was nothing wrong with old Firefox! Everything's changed. Not easy to use, visually unpleasant, lost features. Bad job Firefox"
148370,"I tried to use this browser to open links from twitter, etc. so I configured it to delete the complete browser history on exit. However the "tutorial" or "tour" keeps blocking me from reading the website I opened and I have to complete the steps like tapping the search bar or the privacy grade symbol to continue to read e.g. an article. Unfortunately still happened after about 10 sessions. I would have been fine to complete the "tour" once and be done with it to use the browser the way I want but it is frustrating to be interruped on random occasions about "features" I don't care about. I became too frustrated and uninstalled it. It would be great to have an option to deactivate the "tour" in the settings and just use the browser as is. I liked the rest of the browser performance a lot; sites loaded fast and the Interface was clean (without huge bars at the top and bottom)"
148380,"I tried DDG for a few months, using it as the default browser in my Pixel 3XL. I really wanted it to work, but it just feels like a beta product - too many features missing, UI quirks and just generally annoying bugs/bad design choices. I hope it will get better over time - I'll definitely try DDG again in the future! - but for now I'm back to Chrome, sadly."
148409,"Works great to keep you browser clear of extra tabs.Allows to save favorites,but dosen't allow you to organize or category. Update version had some bugs, remembering settings like dark screen when closing out tab.You still have to go to setting to clear cach files though,so when it supposed to claim that it dosen't leave a trace when you close out....It does!!! The history clears when closing.If anyone used google remembers , clearing your typed history is a pain in the arse."
148415,"They lied . In they ad they said Google own Android not they don't and information out where is the proof of that.You can get Google like if you have an I phone or any phone. There little privacy to non. Have the time dosen't work. People who said it works you live in a dream world. I whish there was a delete button for the worst apps ever I would hit that delete button for this app. I whish I can give you ZERO stars . You deserve it. I give you one star. NOW I'm going to delete you!"
148421,"Everytime I visit a page, go switch to something else, then come back, the page is blank and I have to reload the page to get it back."
148424,"Stupid 'pull to refresh'. it's too sensitive, I get the unintended page reload too many times, remove it now or provide an on / off option for that feature."
148440,"All I can say is that it works great for me. So what your telling me is you will be using my profile from Google. So I might as well just use Google if your just exchanging info with them anyway. This is disappointing to say the least. 😠😡"
148442,"This app worked really well for me for months, but starting last week the app started crashing constantly. Can't use the browser for more than a minute at a time before it freezes."
148443,"I really wanted to like this application, but after two days of use it's very clear, this need some serious work to be considered a top browser. * No pull-down to refresh * if you have more than one tab open and hit the back button, you won't go to the tab was opened previously, but it'll take you out of the app completely. * no customization option to get the tabs accessible from the bottom of the screen or the top. which makes it hard to use in large screen phones."
148452,"everything is fine. But user experience is not so good. Please add (back, forward, reload) button bottom of the main home screen. Ohh Other thing we can't quickly access bookmarks, please look into this."
148453,"After the last update from Samsung/Verizon I can no longer log into my ebay account from DuckDuckGo from my Samsung 9. I have no problems with most other login sites. Despite the msg below from ebay, I have no problems logging on when I use google or Chrome. Please fix ~ Thanks. "The eBay mobile website is no longer supported on this device. Access all your eBay activity from your desktop or a supported Apple, Android or Blackberry mobile device. Copyright © 1995-2018 eBay Inc.""
148475,"It works perfectly before recent update, while the recent update really screw up my browsing experience, the site wont load and need to close the app then open up again so the site could work"
148478,"major flaw. I got this browser hoping that I would not be tracked by anyone because I got tired of Google always tracking what I do. third-party apps buy my data and try to manipulate me into giving them money (eg through ads) anytime a tab is left open for longer than ten minutes, automatically I'm taken to a Google custom search engine. I know this is just another tactic to track me (browser hijacker) and it's not fair because this is a privacy app. Duck duck go was my default browser too"
148486,"It doesn't work after the latest upgrade. It looks like it is working, but after i hit search the page is just completely blank."
148492,"It works everytime I open the app. No issues except hitting the back button to go to a previous page directs you completely out of the page and back to the main search page. That needs work guys."
148527,"Well it is really good on privacy, but it would be better if the playback on sites other than YouTube would stop glitching and causing the entire frame to glitch. So far I've only experienced this issue on mobile."
148530,"Doesn't respond to "near me"...brought up Florida and I'm in Arizona. When I typed in my town and state the app brought up 1 gas station and there are actually 4. (This was just a test). I love the idea of some privacy but I'll wait."
148538,"Can be buggy. Pages don't always load unless you toggle windows. Weird glitch. I appreciate the privacy sentiment but the browser has to be functional."
148549,"Thought it was brilliant at first, really nice layout, tells you which trackers are being blocked etc then you find out that its actually hiding information like 9oo9le does about trafficking and so on 🙃 not for me....and many others!"
148564,"It has no incognito mode. Neither it has more other settings like UC browser. I don't support china however, UC browser was great in use, although I've uninstalled UC browser. So my suggestion to you is kindly make your browser more inhanced.✌🏻"
148569,"The privacy features really work well but the browser lacks functionality. My main annoyance was zooming in on pages is made somewhat obscure as the standard zoom gesture is not supported. I would prefer a browser which is standardised in terms of user interface. Other than that the app is fast and lightweight. The tips can become annoying though and my brief review didn't lead to me removing them. I really like DuckDuckGo but their Android browser was not for me."
148587,"The app will almost always make your screen turn black when browsing. When you scroll down, it will turn back to normal, but upon returning to the same spot, it will turn black again."
148590,"This app has great features regarding keeping your internet surfing private. But there are 2 items that prevented me from giving you a 5* revie, crawling through a puddl,.e of glue. I have several apps to keep my phone clean. Regardless of how many times I clean my phone your app is still runs about 1/8 the speed of Firefox. I'm going to keep it installed hoping that you will make some changes."
148595,"A god awful dysfunctional mess. It hijacks any other search engine I try to use, is slower than molasses in January and mostly just tells me it is searching until it times out. A colossal time wasted, soon to be uninstalled unless it is made functional. Every time I try to launch it, the screen freezes. When the wait close or report icon pops up, I click report, the screen goes black, and a page headed ":Google Legal " pops up, wanting me to agree to terms of service. I think Google does it"
148608,"One recent change that almost forces me to jump to another browser is the refresh when scrolling up. Allow us to turn it off. It's too sentive and annoying."
148612,"The browser has stopped working recently. New searches make it freeze for long time, then pop up an error message."
148613,"Happy. It does what it says. I wish switching between tabs was made a little facilitating like long press on tab button & just slide left/right as your tabs appear as pages of book."
148615,"I installed DDG two days ago and it was working fine.. but since today it doesn't open any websites .. Plz fix the problem it's useless to have browser app that doesn't work. Thanks"
148640,"Its average. I close it and when I reopen to search up something else it has my old search page up and a lot of times I have retype what I'm searching because it won't go through. Needs some work but it has potential"
148643,"Wants full storage permission and full network access. So much for privacy. Also, the app crashes on startup. Samsung s10+, latest version of Android. Smh."
148651,"It is a good browser but it'd be a lot nicer if it could have a functionality similar to "Dark Reader" add-on on Firefox android. Not just the search listings, we need the actual webpages in dark mode too."
148656,"Loved this app alot untill the recent update where now for some reason the in browser theme you set will just erase itself after a few openings of the browser. This is really annoying especially when it comes to searching things at night when I don't want bright white light shining in my face. Otherwise great app, but please fix this it's very annoying."
148664,"Overall it's a nice browser, but search results are more controlled then in Google even with safe search off. Still prefer to use Opera with free vpn on private tab."
148673,"Uses the same censored results as google, it may promote its concern for privacy but it has no issues about google's cencorship of sites that do not openly support the liberal agenda. Search for non censored search engines, they are what Google used to be like many years ago."
148708,"It should have it's own folder as apps like UC browser does so that downloads can be tracked easily. Its previous pages remain open for only short times making it difficult to go back after a few pages forward."
148716,"Used to be great, now it won't play any video on Facebook, YouTube, or anywhere else. It just sticks on a flashing, jerky, stroke inducing spasm... Bye-bye going to have to uninstall you now."
148718,"I don't know what happened since the update but now it's not deleting data automatically. Theres not even a way to officially "close" the app to make sure it cleans"
148739,"An unacceptable number of pages load improperly. Also the back button skips pages altogether. Overall its just poorly made. I like the lack of ads, but still wish the application ran better"
148743,"Really needs some bug fixes like playing videos with out having the whole app crash, search results feels kinda random, phone's "back" button kicks me out of the app. Tbh tho I still prefer it over any other search engine."
148746,"This app sucks now! I used to like it a lot but now search results don't load, pages flicker and I can't use it without running into a problem"
148749,"This app does not do what it says it does at all. I have searched things on this app and gotten ads on YouTube related to what I searched. For example, if i searched "most popular seafood restaurants" I would get an add on YouTube about seafood. I would also like to point out that I found out about this via YouTube, and who owns YouTube? Google, a company that is talked poorly about in their ads. Not only that but this app is on the GOOGLE play store."
148750,"Love the app, but.......videos have stopped playing on FB and YouTube fails to load. Don't know if it's a problem with embedded video or something but when it's fixed, it'll get 5 stars."
148751,"That banner popping up over the keyboard saying 'Multiple domains found' is torture. I can't stand it!! Everything else is good but it's knocking 2 stars off. I almost gave it 2 stars instead of 3."
148753,"Have been using it for years with good luck but I recently got a Samsung A51 and it's acting erratically. Starts flickering and won't load pages."
148780,"Very nice. Would be better if it used the Gecko/Firefox engine, though! It seems like Mozilla should be a natural partner for DDG."
148803,"This latest update has broken the app completely. Now whenever i search something or visit a new website the pages don't show up on my screen. The screen remains completely blank even if the page has been loaded"
148835,"Great browser. Can't import bookmark? Really? You want people to use your product but sure don't make it easy to transition."
148844,"DuckDuckGo to go. I like the browser and search engine itself, but the app needs some features. It feels sometimes too basic, inbuilt NIGHT MODE is must have nowadays. Please Devs, improve your app. It would make our lives better. Thanks."
148848,"Search engine is bad. It doesn't show exactly what i'm looking for. I can't even change search engine. Also horizontal scrolling doesn't work on some websites 👎"
148852,"Worked fine for a few days then would not display the mobile site I requested after that, instead continually displaying the desktop site....on a mobile phone!"
148853,"Functionality is good. As far as real time protection of data I believe it is good there. I would like to see speak to search added."
148877,"I did really like this app. But since the update, web pages are timing out and never loading. Disappointed by what was a great app."
148882,"Hard to use and doesn't work half of the time but you can info that Google doesn't want you see if you can get it to work. This app needs top fixed as it has the potential to be great."
148883,"The app has to be fake the ad video says that "you may not now that Google has trackers on you " but Google play puts it out? Not only that but me and my grandmother used it and it blocked the same amount of websites related to google???"
148885,"Like duck duck browser but I trouble that every time I have it open & leave it to get details from another app, that I wiped all pages I was on & goes back to home page & I loose everything. Like being in Google doing a two way authentication, need to into my email to get the code & whoosh all gone. How can I set it that it stays on the page I am on & not go back to home page?"
148892,"Nice app with some random freezes. All works fine, without adds and tracking. But quite often it just freezed when i open a web browser and didnt help to open it again. Will see if they will improve it soon, otherwise will returm back to previous browser . EDIT2(25/2/): totally not usable browser, constantly freezes, pages dont loaded, app killed and tried many times, sorry going to look for some other browser"
148906,"Okay. 1st. This browser swears your it's a privacy browser. When it's not. You should be able to go, anywhere. Yet all sites still are aware of what country your in. If your company is true to privacy protection. Then fix this problem. Cause with a "True privacy browser" I should be able to go to any site in any country. Without that site knowing my location."
148909,"The browser is great and all. I dont have any complaints at all except few days ago every streaming site went to turns the screen black and makes it impossible to use."
148922,"This is a featureless browser that needs a lot of work. It would be okay if it were a beta but the tab navigation is cumbersome and lacks advanced anything. What DuckDuckGo has to offer is base browser that mishandles everything other than link navigation, I am disappointed with it after using it extensively, we deserve better than this, go look elsewhere if you want a just ok browser, cause doesn't make the grade."
148934,"Great app, it need more work though. The app literally stops on its own and you need to start over again."
148937,"Minimal setting options. Plus had a really hard time getting bookmarks to actually go to bookmarked page. Too bad, I use it as a search engine on brave and that works well."
148956,"Just put a home screen for 1 tap bookmark and a save page feature and this will be perfect. Edit: also put navigation buttons at the bottom for 1 hand navigation. Edit: back and forward button would be nice. Thanks!"
148969,"If you play games DO NOT install this app. It makes you reinstall everything. And hides all of your google apps so you cant find them. I liked the idea of privacy but that's a little bit much. I dont want to start my games all over. Otherwise would be a great app. But not when it messes with your apps."
148970,"Great EXCEPT...Please MAKE THE SPACE BAR BIGGER. I love this search engine and I use it in lieu of Google now. and I am so happy about that. But PLEASE make the space bar bigger. It is seriously the biggest turn off. will up the rating to a 5, if you do this. 👍🏻"
148987,"Looked great. Seemed to be fast. Went to my favorite site Facebook. Unable to use speech to text. No way to turn off incognito. Uninstall."
149020,"I am new to your duck duck go I watched a movie in online. It to many ads if I touth player I go to a another tab so please stop many ads .I also need Answer my question I need Answer"
149030,"Not sure how many stars I want to give, now so far it's working like it should but I really want to know how to shut off the suggestion for checking out websites every time I bring it up"
149033,"There is some bug in there..the entire browser page flickers when trying to play video lot of the times. E.g. you try to play a video on twitter, the page flickers and i can't see anything."
149044,"Can NOT save, backup or restore bookmarks ie: just got a new phone and I can't use my many saved bookmarks. I will be switching back to Chrome. 2 yrs of bookmarks lost."
149076,"Good app when you temporarily want to do something. But as soon as you want to login and write emails etc the UI gets messed up and you eventually find yourself going back to use Chrome."
149077,"Everything is good. But it can't block some pop up and ads. And some features and options are missing than a usual browser..... After all, love the company for privacy"
149082,"I wanted to like this browser, but no way to export bookmarks let alone organize them. Back to searching for a useful browser."
149098,"Did NOT work/function. Every website would function. Would go to next page, would not give me correct information. Looking for something I got an info page but could not go beyond it. Uninstalled..."
149105,"It phones home every start and sends every link you click to some central server for processing with no way to turn off the features that need link tracking. If you trust ddg completely then you will be fine, but I'm not sure how this can viewed as 'Private'."
149108,"I love the app because it is a good one. Reasons I rate 3 star is that it does not have the feature to save a page to offline view and secondly, the picture I downloaded on the browser could not be found anywhere in my gallery. Pls do something about it I will give the remaining 2 stars."
149112,"Good on Apple terrable on Android. Settings really need polishing for Android/Samsung devices. There's no direct link to bookmarks forcing us to select the tab to the side just to get to bookmarks & to download images we gotta view file adding more click & not crazy about having to hold the image down to bring up the download prompt. Doing things with fewer clicks should be a priority for the user interface to make it better."
149125,"Good, until recently. Now, when viewing videos, the screen often goes black/blank, and the page has to be refreshed before it will show anything."
149132,"Screen blacks out when scrolling almost constantly, history doesnt save after turning off your phone, practically unusable in certain situations."
149147,"I loved the privacy policy of this app and it's Blockage of google crawlers all around also it is very profound. But the app lacks when sites that are redirected are blocked and return us to homepage with blank text and previous text is gone.videos in YouTube aren't resolution wise friendly as it is has compatibility issues.but google crawlers are not completely blocked away they can still trace us as location is mentioned below the web page."
149158,"It gets really slow when using maps and real t me apps. That's my major complaint, fix the speed and aside from that the engine is strong and kicks tush:p"
149162,"seems like a nice browser, smooth for the 20 minutes i have used it. but i played a browser based html game, and it has embeded gifs/videos in it, and the browser didn't play them at all. it showed one huge img like an "play arrow icon" but nothing else. i didn't find any way to enable those videos/gifs"
149178,"Rubbish, it freezes up at least 6 out of 10 searches. I've been using DDG since the year it was launced but they just can't seem to make a good phone app."
149189,"Love the privacy, no tracking& nice alternative from google. Gave it 3 stars b/c navigation isn't too easy for me. I'm not speaking for everyone else, just me."
149208,"They collect cookies and share them. They're not private. I think they definitely now have a deal with Google. I place a search on duckduckgo then I open up Google and what do you know an ad for the same thing I just searched on duckduckgo magically pops up on Google. 🙄"
149211,"I like its privacy options. However, i find that its search capabilities need a lot more work and the reasults are not that great. This forces me to go back to use google. At that point, it isnt clear to me if the privacy of this app is still helpful or not"
149220,"Hey duckduckgo browser now a time you are not private and i was sure about it your adblocker is so useless that they couldn't block ads now properly like rummy circle ads and all pop ups I strongly thinking that you tie ups or something else drama with google and other gients so you loosing our trust now very sad duckducgo ."
149222,"Would move to this browser in a heartbeat if there was the means to import bookmarks. Seems like this would be a standard function within a browser app."
149223,"Good. But consumes a lot of 🔋 battery. And it closes on it's own even though I've opted it wait until i close the app myself! Upsetting, I have to login constantly!"
149232,"Not bad, when it works. Last update seemed to add bugs and diminish performance instead of fixing them."
149237,"Vertually unusable, as the browser keeps freezing. Very disappointing as I wanted to use this one. Even worse since last update... And no better after the newest update again. How hard can it be!"
149274,"So far so good! Update: Screen keeps blacking out when using the app. I like the encryption and ability to clear history with one click."
149277,"this is really to the creator if this app is on GOOGLE PLAY! cant they still see what you play and what apps you use and what your doing on those apps? so no point in downloading this app.Also i dont get ads AND DUDE google gives you a choice to turn on ad block."
149282,"It keeps freezing up. I had to uninstall the app. I added it as my search engine for chrome. I really wish the app was better, i prefer the features it has"
149284,"No real use. I dint use social media, other than YouTube, and it didnt work with my fav radio station (kept shutting down), so i just have no real use for it."
149298,"Last update broke YouTube videos in full screen. Please fix. And please add a way to turn off pull down to refresh. I can't scroll up with out a page refreshing."
149305,"Not worth downloading if you can't import/export bookmarks. I've got many years and hundreds of bookmarks on Chrome. There's no way im starting over."
149317,"I just started using the app, and so far I really like it. I have been able to find things that google censors. I hope after using it longer, I can give you a 5 star. Thank you for giving us a different search engine that is not censored."
149320,"its good for amazon shopping and browsing but not good for youtube because in full screen mode while watching a playlist even though it blocks ads it goes out of full screen and hides the youtube icon buttons and makes it difficult to navigate. plus i don't know if it blocks snoopy busness on apps like messenger and tubi and other free media streaming apps."
149327,"Lately this app has been loading very slowly and in occasion it doesn't even load completely. I like the app but it's lost quality."
149338,"It freezed when I used it for the first time I have deleted and reinstalled, the second time it worked for a few minutes and then it froze again and refuses to work no matter what. It worked in the past, it didn't work well but it tried to do its job. Now it's completely corrupt"
149343,"Too slow. After initial set up I was able to load one page, after that I tried searching several different topics at different times and none would load."
149353,"Someone told me this browser would give me more websites than google but I dont know where. Even when not in use it will steal the page you are on and lose it. Then theres no way to get the page back because it erases history. Maddening!"
149363,"It would be AWESOME but has no voice search which is a bit of a pain, if it DID HAVE A VOICE SEARCH & ALSO GET THE CORRECT ANSWER EVERYTIME THEN IT WOULD GET 5 STARS😕🙃🙃😕"
149391,"31 Aug - uninstalled. Need settings for cookies, scripts and autoplay. Keep at it. *Interestingly, my previous rating re: autoplay was missing/deleted. Hmm..."
149405,"Good browser. Seems to cut out the irritating ads. But the swift keyboard is not permitting Hollo layout! Please can fix this anomaly on Galaxy Tab 6️⃣"
149408,"I just recently had a problem with DuckDuckGo I typed Manga into the search bar. Something completely unrelated to manga came up someone needs to fix that problem. A list of Animated characters come up instead of Manga those two things have nothing to with each other. DuckDuckGo must fix that issue."
149410,"It prevents the tracking from Google and other Companies, but it isn't that good. While viewing any media you have to spare more time than other browsers, but the thing for what it is being developed feels so good. Hope you people make it much faster :)"
149411,"So far my only complaint is that I can't use the arrow that allows me to go back to the previous page . Instead, I have to type the web address in again to begin anew."
149425,"You are bugging me with icons on the top of my phone. I will uninstall your app because I do not like being bothered unlesa I ask to be bother. Your app bothers me"
149437,"Very slow. The app crashed frequently. I suggest you should use another app. I have a andriod 7. Don't know if this happens to everyone with different versions of the phone."
149442,"Great browser. One complaint that ruins the experience is that it starts saving files as .bin And i have to clear cache every time - I'd rather switch to another browser"
149446,"Get rid of those pathetic scrolling messages every time I do something! Dear god, how old are you... 3? And no add-ons so can't even load uBlock. Even worse than the new Firefox which is now useless."
149482,"I 'm giving 1 star coz if Google play have option for 0 star rating so I definitely give it u seriously this is Most worst app I have ever seen in my life after beeing downloading this web browser it doesn' t show any download box where I was downloaded my files and the bad part is the files that I have downloaded they can't open pathetic app please don't download this I seriously recommended you and if u do u will regret after that! 😠👎👎"
149498,"It's okay as a browser, but I'm still getting targeted ads related to things I've searched up only on this app. I don't think it's doing what it's advertised to do."
149500,"I love duckduckgo but until they fix 2 things I can't use this browser: 1: choice to move address bar/tab switcher to bottom for taller phones and 2: integration of autofill for password manager apps like Dashlane."
149501,"I would have liked a better tab switching mechanism like chrome has. Also desktop mode doesn't work for me on any site."
149508,"Someone is pretending to be me using this app I only made a Google mail but I'm hooked up to Yahoo and all kind of stuff that I didn't even create and they are using this app"
149514,"1. Please add a feature no image or only text. 2. Tab clean icon must be below for fast and why it ask after I tap on icon. 3. When I switch apps it shows website open in the browser."
149554,"Sometime it get stuck when loading a page and freeze when i try to open new tab it not work and i have to close the app and restart it .."
149569,"The all was perfect until a recent update, where on my galaxy s8, the screen turns black while scrolling through websites, will deserve 5 stars once this issue is fixed."
149575,"Excellent for protecting privacy but from a user experience perspective, it feels a little like using a very old browser."
149576,"Keeps replacing beneficial audio. Avoid it. Went to visit the site afterwards on opera, got sounds bad for the mind."
149577,"Every update deletes all of the bookmarks. What's the point of having that function? Also the app runs in the background after the app has been closed, wasting battery and using data."
149580,"If they dont fix the issue of new windows popping up and opening every 15 minutes or so, and interupting what I'm doing all the time, DuckDuckGo is about to be DuckDuckGone from my Android phone..."
149583,"Great app and browser, however it constantly crashes if scrolling through pages and is slow at other times."
149593,"Total waste of time I don't know what's changed but I've given it 6 different chances to answer questions Etc. And it always comes back with quote no suggestions on quote. So what gives? I just deleted it and probably will never go back unless someone gives me a good answer!!!!!!"
149596,"Beta test updates before releasing for wider use. Scrolling is now too sensitive and often causes unwanted page refresh."
149605,"The combination of: 1. Doesn't keep history at all, which isn't configurable (presume for privacy reasons) 2. Accidentally hitting the back button replaces newly opened links with empty pages 3. There is no forwards button Makes this browser unusable from my perspective."
149675,"If I choose to forget my search by tapping on the Fire icon🔥 DDG also forgets my settings (eg Dark Theme). Tired of resetting my settings again and again so I'm uninstalling DDG."
149686,"Does anyone else have issues using the push to talk mic located on the search bar? Mine has a line through like I can't use it"
149691,"It's missing very basic features, like being able to set a homepage and new tabs opening up to that homepage."
149701,"Love the app but all of a sudden a little while ago it basically broke. Whenever I'd open a website it would glitch and then go black it made it unusable."
149730,"The new update is really poor. Once Videos start playing in duckduckgk the whole phone starts flashing and then I have to close the app. Please fix this issue."
149760,"ISSUES - 1.Does not block trackers on Google domains. 2. Dark theme not applicable to webpages. 3. Doesn't have Print option. 4. Doesn't have option for cookies setting (block and remove after quiting browser). 5. Doesn't give good results for India specific contents and news."
149761,"Crashing and only loading pages half way. Sometimes it loads completely but I have a blank white screen."
149792,"It was good untill recently now when I go on the hub my screen blacks out like its completely black and it randomly turns back to normal so like I could be half way thought a video then it blacks out."
149793,"Do not use this product as Just updated and in the process deleted all favourite web pages saved to my home screen??"
149835,"That Clippy duck needs to go. The fire icon needs an option to remove from address bar. Need option to set custom homepage."
149836,"At first I loved it. Then it would allow others to install or do stuff without my permission At first thought it was the real deal. Maybe it s me my phone always gets haqued..."
149843,"Slow to load and freezes up frequently. Minimizing app causes loaded websites to close and lose data. Must reopen websites frequently. App is very frustrating."
149852,"Another update... newly broken functionality. I'm forced to restart my browser every time I unlock and open my phone. Shows nothing but a white page"
149857,"Loved the concept but there were too many thanks ngs I didn't like. Can't go back after clicking a link. Can't swipe down to refresh. Can't cut and paste. Can't do voice search. Maybe it's just my phone but not for me."
149865,"Having issue when using back button browser. When used doesn't to previous page, but exits app altogether."
149897,"I usually use Google Chrome as my main browser. I'm a fan of the password saving feature, and the bookmarks feature. DuckDuckGo doesn't save your passwords, but you can save bookmarks, if you want to."
149911,"I was using this app just for a few hours and makes me crazy, every few seconds app was reloading and moving me to another page. When I had live chat and suddenly app closed window and opened new one I said Enough is enough!!!!! From my privet perspective I DO NOT recommend"
149931,"Search result is very worst, everytime switching to Chrome to get the answer . Only good at keeping privacy safe and fast response whether result is right or wrong"
149939,"I give Duckduckgo 3 star's because I've only had it for two days only used 4 to 5 times. So far I love it mainly because of the no tracking. It will also tell you who trying to track you!"
149959,"Its the good app. You get what you want, and they tell you if they don't have what you need, except that it has more of YouTube in videos"
149985,"Everytime I search I get nothing but a blank screen. Would really like to find a good search app that ACTUALLY works instead of Google."
149986,"I need access to the full settings. Some selections are unavailable without details as to why they're blocked."
150020,"Nice browser but its a data zapper. No data management. You can't lower image quality. I notice also it doesn't block ads"
150025,"I don't know why but the app has a problem with spam. I noticed the web extention doesn't have this problem just this app."
150041,"Uninstalling because I was on a random Quora(question forum) page and among the 'suggested'(based on traffic/trends) was "promoted by duckduckgo". that is unacceptable to be talking about how sites breach your privacy by pushing their product/service to then turn around and do the same. I'm massively disappointed and fortunately, unlike Google, completely avoiding you won't be difficult. Sort it out. - a disheartened ex-fan"
150044,"No button at the bottom to take u to the top of the page. So slider either on the side. It would be better if it had these features. All the text is much smaller than necessary. Trying to fix it in the phone settings doesn't solve it completely."
150060,"This app turns on your mic so I uninstalled, they claim to protect your privacy but there the ones spying on you, be very careful there not what they claim be."
150090,"Add barcode/qr-code scanning feature so that we don't have to install other apps for it unnecessarily. And also give a feature to offline webpages."
150105,"Is very good compared to other privacy browsers. But my app has a problem where when im trying to watch youtube on the browser sometimes the screen will turn black on some videod"
150122,"Great for privacy, but I hate that you can't organize your bookmarks. It's hard to commit to using it as a primary browser."
150139,"Seems ok. Sometimes audio doesnt stop when i close a youtube tab. Video sometimes doesnt scale properly in youtube. Dosent translate lanuages in searches."
150152,"Like there needs to be a "tutorial" for an f***ing browser. This Browser has done nothing but gone downhill."
150156,"Finding the app at times glitches and often crashes. Great for privacy but unfortunately I am not in a position to stop using chrome as their product is far more superior. I have now moved to Cake and uninstalled this app."
150171,"I appreciate that they allow me to browse without being monitored. However, most of the time when I search for something, the search engine does not provide me with the information I looking for. It is frustrating and pretty much defeats the purpose of a search engine."
150198,"The worst browser that seems to be stuck on stupid! It has limited subject matter on every search I tried, very disappointing!"
150217,"Decent browser. Runs smoother and faster than Chrome but built in default search engine is garbage. Prefer searching through Google Search."
150229,"Just this rating for now. There was a site that this app was not able to connect me to. I'm still observing. But I like it for being able to penetrate natural health sites which Google now blocks."
150233,"When I try to search, for some words the suggestions come in urdu language. Why so? I don't know Urdu and neither I am from an Islamic country. Its so irritating at times. Please fix this mess up."
150238,"I love this App for Their Service. But I Uninstalled it only for one reason that is this App doesn't provide Add Block Option.

150245,"This application has zero filter on it. If any bad junk or negative influencers are on the side that You are on, then you have to do the hard part by denying the temptation of what you might accidentally view..."
150251,"There is no "Downloads" hub. The browser doesn't give any sort of notification about the download progress. Heck, I checked my system's file manager for the ongoing downloads and it showed me ZERO progress. Terrible browser for downloading stuff!"
150252,"Doesn't fit to mobile even with desktop unchecked. And many sites only load half way then stop so I can't use this. Galaxy s10e, all up to date."
150269,"Why aren't there any plugins like other browser. Like save page to pdf, changing the name of the downloads while downloading, and a separate download icon gear"
150272,"Why is this app not honoring my auto update settings? I use it, but please DO NOT by pass my settings."
150293,"Works well. Search results excellent. Setting are a pain to manage and saving and loading settings a bigger pain."
150310,"Despite all the good things, scrolling up is a nightmare. It's refreshing even to a small scroll up swipe."
150314,"Its is one of the best browser but please make it faster.It takes more time than other browsers to load pages.Give it an update and also include download option."
150336,"ok...If this app is very concern about our privacy then why there is an another option for private search(in a hidden place)....why this option is not enabled by default..."
150354,"Over all it's a great Web search I guess I'm just so used to Google it's going to take me some time to get used to this."
150414,"It's just not ready to play with the other browsers yet. Also, their search results are worse than bing's."
150451,"Bug: Webpage refreshing when multiwindow mode opened. (Splitscreen two apps). Device info: lg g8x (in single screen mode). Android 10."
150472,"3 star because your downloading performance is too poor I am not satisfied with your downloading facility My suggestion You must improve and work on fast downloading system"
150477,"This app was great until recent updates. The screen keeps on flashing black whenever you look something up. Please fix."
150483,"It's Basically "Chrome" , Nothing Special ! 😒 UPDATE : Aug-2020 -: it Uses Heavy data via Internet Connection . (Maybe Stealing some Data From Phone ) Be Alert !!!"
150485,"Not a bad browser but my main reason for trying it was that it made the impression that it would encrypt websites that had a https version available automatically which i found out wasn't true. I still had to manipulate the url myself."
150489,"Love the app but for some reason whenever I go in the browser whatever website I'm on it turns black and starts glitching really bad please fix this!"
150511,"They need to replace the keyboard input mode whenever you begin a search. As it stands now, opening the app will begin with the keyboard in web address mode, meaning you have to type spaces between every word. When's the last time you've needed to manually enter a web address? l want to use this app as a search program, but it functions more like a browser at the moment. I've made suggestions to change this, but no luck so far."
150525,"i had it downloaded bout two weeks ago. i would be in middle of a program and it would kick me out only to have to start all over again. At this time i hope this is fixed. Sometimes a program is unable to be found again, or if it happens during a survey, a letter or filing a complaint then you have lost it or have to start all over again. it is 17:49 and from 17:38 to now this site hs crashed 4 times as im trying to read a news story. Be nice if you people would fix it."
150554,"nah... but its got potential. i used it both on android and as an alternative to Google. my biggest issue was to get away from Bing and Google. unfortunately this browser uses Bing for searches. half the time the results failed to load. there were other search results from other sources that were ok, but Bing was always top of the list. good privacy, bad search results meant searching elsewhere which really defeats the purpose of the exercise. i love the uk results switch, but it wasnt 100%"
150571,"Browser not upto expectations! Reviews are biased. Brave browser is the best. This browser doesn't block pop up ads. Or does anything at all"
150591,"I really love this app and use it to look up pretty much anything. Lately, however, whenever I look something up and I hit the go back button, it goes straight to the start page, instead of the previous one. I was able to counteract it at first by clearing all data, but even that doesn't work anymore. I find this new development to be very user-unfriendly and I'm hoping that this will be fixed soon. Until then, however, I cannot give a higher rating."
150621,"Flickers upon scrolling video, gmail browser splits up. Something has been broken recently (last month), please fix very annoying."
150633,"I would like to use this app. But user experience problems make it unusable for me. When using the back button, instead of taking me back to the previous page. It takes me back to the Duck Duck Go search page and I have to start all over. This makes the app a no go. In addition the keyboard it forces me to use is awkward, the space bar is way too narrow and causes typing errors which uses more of my time. The bottom line is the app wastes too much of my time with UX problems. Fix these issue's and I'm in!"
150641,"Cool app for serious minded people. Privacy guaranteed. I recomend people to download it ONLY if they will keep improving on the app. This app needs a whole lot of work. It is a lovely app though. But they need a lot of work. You cant have another window open with the information loaded already. You have to wait. Please change that."
