3,"Not a problem with the app, as I didn't even pass through Log In screen. I forgot my Wikipedia password and on entering wrong password twice and clicking on "Forgot my password", it says you are Blocked. I don't want to create a new account as I have made several edits using that account and there's no way to log in to my previous account. It always says Blocked. Horrible experience.😥"
9,"I have been using Wikipedia for many days and it is a very good medium to get information, but it has the same problem that if you create an account in it, then it is log out in two days. I log in again, but again p log out. This is the only problem. Please fix it and send me a response, I will wait for your answer to diagnose my problem No i download wikipedia on my phone and login with the same (Redmi 7A)"
12,"Its not working for the past couple of days. It just says 'Can't connect, check Internet', even though my phone is connected to WiFi and all the other apps are working fine. This is a really great app and I use it quite a lot, but this recent issue is causing a lot of inconvenience. Please look into the matter ASAP. Thankyou"
15,"Horizontal scrolling ruins this app. Wikipedia is an incredible website but reading articles on a phone with this app is just frustrating. For articles with paragraphs embedded in tables you have to scroll left and right for every line of text just to read it (a great example of this is any list of episodes article for a TV show). Why bother making a mobile app if it's not mobile friendly? If you won't fix this at least add a button to open such articles in a web browser."
19,"Absolutely love this app especially for people needing help with information or meaning of words or how to help spelling but never understand why I couldn't access the whole app but this app just confirmed everything that is happening to me someone else is using all my accounts terrified of using the internet now I know why i couldn't access all of this app plus IP address says blocked plus you found 8 unknown IP addresses that are rerouting mine to other countries and using my accounts"
27,"This app, for some unknown reason, blocked me. It's been hard, as I have not been able to reset password, and I am worried I have lost saved. I unblock on the 2nd July, so fingers crossed. Not as good as the desktop, but handy."
30,"I've Had The Wikipedia App For A While. I Really Never Used The App That Much. I Mainly Used The Website. So I Was Looking At An Article And Accidentally Clicked The Edit Button While Scrolling Down And It Said You Have Been Banned From Editing. I Thought It Could Of Been A Glitch So I Opened The App And Went To Suggested Edits And It Said My Account Was Blocked. I Attempted To Make A New Account Since I Thought This Was A Mistake. I Looked Into It, And It Said I Was Blocked. Dont Get This App!"
33,"This is the only app that I have that is completely unusable with Android Dark Mode. It apparently prints black text on the black background so you can't even tell that there is text. The only thing visible is hyperlinks. Useless."
34,"This Has Got To Be The Most Ridiculous App I've Ever Had Before. They Won't Allow Me To Add To The List I Want To Add It To. They Allow Themselves To Add It To My Reading List And Only My Reading List. When I Should Be Able To Add It To My Own List That I Create. Otherwise Why Would They Have: Create List. In Other Words: Create Your Own List."
35,"Failed to work on my device. Appears to be using a browser-based interface, which isn't responsive. Other browsers work fine on my device, so could be a compatibility issue, but poor marks for backwards-compatibility if that's the case. Uninstalling."
42,"Its generally good but I didnt give it 5 because I don't understand why it doesn't have tabs like in the browser? Makes it quite tedious to navigate to the section you want."
48,"One of the worst organization it blocked me until 2021 I didn't edit a single letter or I didn't used this for advertisement the users block the new users anonymously I didn't do anything with the app. And the users blocked my 2 other friends they also didn't do anything. This is disgusting and annoying. Good bye Wikipedia. You also support nepotism. I thinked this is the best site but you are worst. They block users simply even user didn't do anything"
49,"Wikipedia app for Android doesn't load content any longer. It's been a few days like this. I have Asus tablet with Android 4.1 on it. How do I return to previous version?"
51,"please add Watchlist functionality. it's available on the mobile browser but not the app, and that's kinda nuts... it sucks that it isn't there, and it's the main way to patrol commonly vandalised articles. please add it"
66,"Hey, i used a username and password by different way. But, not it shows to login. But, now it ask me to login. I get irritated. Why it happen? Now I'm going to uninstall this application. No use of this."
68,"I find so much trouble logging into the Wikipedia App, I don't understand where the problem is. My username and password are all correct, I'm so sure about that"
70,"Sometimes, e.g. when searching an article in a tab or when opening a link, the current tabs get replaced and all the tab article history is lost. Sucks big time. Fix, then 5 stars"
78,"The website is far better than this app, what's wrong with the English, I think the writer doesn't know English very well, still a nice app"
88,"Can't zoom in the pages when reading, the more options button is not just a more options button and can't turn off conditional highlighting while editing pages by a code."
93,"An error occurred (code 429) when open in any Chinese language."
98,"all ok except that if selected theme is dark, background becomes dark but also text keeps black, hence unreadable. android 6 meizu m5s"
99,"When I try to login it takes me to the create account page. Kindly check into this."
109,"Experience was great until today when Wikipedia acted like I'd never been a user before. I use it daily. Weird. Is this a shakedown?"
118,"The in-browser experience provides a neater, cleaner homepage"
129,"I am unable to create an account...whenever i'm trying it's showing an error"
132,"Unable to use on tablet. Says no internet connection though it has"
133,"Sadly i just give you 3 star you know why this is my fitst time to download this app ang i have a mobile load my question is :is this up will still functioning even you doesnt have a mobile load??"
141,"Uninstalling, 😠😠😠😠 Ain't processing in my phone. It's keep showing "an occurred arise" Uselesssssssss...... Only waste my time😠😠😠"
146,"Wiki block my account. No reason at all. Without any notification on my email. Stupid app."
147,"This is best stupid encyclopedia because its everything is unclean, unclear, vague, 3 articles are not relative to current one(one example is always shows "dòng máu anh hùng" at vast majority of article) or it should randomly(3 articles should vary after every time of load action) or otherwise it should exists at least 9 ones!!!!! - humans behind Wikipedia should think nor consider this rigorously!!!!!!!!!!"
151,"Has some serious usability issues. The main problem is the way tables are rendered on a small screen: they're very difficult to scroll horizontally and the rows cannot be sorted by column. Also, when editing an article, this app trashes edits, without warning, if a browser or other app loads another article."
153,"Completely open to misrepresentation of facts, Wikipedia has lost its credibility. It is a great collection of articles the factual side of which can be dubious."
155,"Latest update has slowed down the app conaiderably"
157,"I hate the facet that I can't login using my google account cause I don't usually remember my password and username. Can't that be added to the app please?!!!"
160,"I think they should have a tutorial for new users. I could not use it in first moments.Now I can use the app."
172,"Wikipedia as an idea gets five stars. One star is deducted for the English main page which contains only a third of the content of the website, and another gets deducted for not allowing me to include the main page in my feed anymore (since the update, which i now regret installing). When not looking for a specific topic, the main page is my little curiosity playground. I will spend a lot less time and attention on this app now."
173,"The app hasn't worked in about a year despite updates. Opening any article only displays a small amount of text and the articles's image and allows no scrolling or further display. It's essentially unusable."
179,"App is good but, login proces बकवास 😠😠"
184,"It's politically correct and biased. Also it won't start for me on my Galaxy A51."
186,"This is really good app but I think google must be include Google translate tool in it to translate a particular sentence in a particular language to easy to read. I know you include translation tool in it but it translate entire text which is not necessary sometimes."
196,"Just another example of the biased MSM. What happened. Somethings are accurate some are complete trash"
204,"terribly annoyed by 2 big issues: no search function and no library for quick downloading a lot of related articles and offline usage. after all, without the second, why bother with an app over a web app?! and without the first, why bother using this instead of kiwix?"
208,"Wikipedia is another of those platforms which decides what is to be posted. It takes a bunch of people in the edit team to allow publishing of content that confirms to their political belief. This sets a dangerous precedent, one which is spread like a disease, it's nothing different from slowly becoming akin to 1984. It's a shame! Wikipedia has failed."
210,"My account has been banned and I am not able to regain or change my password and I have done nothing abusive. But they said that they have done that to stop abusive changes. What is that?"
211,"Long time fan of the Wikipedia site and app but since 2 updates ago I can no longer get the app to display pages properly on my Android 5 phone. The top lines are chopped off. Can tou so something about that please? Thanks!"
222,"This was great, unlit for some reason all of my bookmarks can't load when I'm offline? Why The Only I reason have this app to by pass time and to read something. Now I don't even NEED this app anymore because of it."
230,"I never had a wikipedia account and when I created one it says that my ip address is blocked What does that mean ?"
231,"Normally a great reading experience. But as of recently the "Main page" has removed the current events thread. Seems inaccesible through the app. Sort it out please guys."
240,"While it provides important information most of the time, some important articles are highly infected by propagandists that do not state facts but opinions. This hurts the reliability of the enciclopedia. There also not an easy way to make a complaint about the issue. The information is public and available through other sources. I would not recommend Wikipedia as reliable source."
242,"Images do not work in the latest update. You click on an image to see an expanded preview and all it does is give a 404"
249,"Yet another biased organization with zero credibility. Their editors have inherent bias towards conservatives. This bias is visible in the way various conservative individuals, news outlet are described! Zero credibility."
250,"I never used the app or even created one on the site. I'd like to know why my ip address was blocked from creating an account."
260,"Worst update ever! Won't load, won't scroll, won't do anything. Would give it no stars if possible."
265,"When we read in English and I need proper meaning of that word, and your app is not good for that. So you should give option of Google translate or search"
268,"I tried to edit an information in Wikipedia which was actually stated wrong. But Wikipedia banned me for 3 years for editing. I don't know what is wrong. It should have sent me any notification or pop up message if it I was about to make any mistake. Really upset!"
272,"Its not working on my tab, now on my phone as well"
275,"The app has no function in Lenovo tablet I ám using. It shows nothing."
277,"Some important topics are edited by people of some countries in their favour. Those articles are no longer providing correct information. And now, few articles can't be edited. I request you to unlock the article "Kalapani Territory" because few information provided there are absolutely false."
279,"Very good site but the app have some problem, main page don't show correct in persian language"
285,"Strong left bias but pretty good otherwise."
291,"There is no option for Hindi translation of some articles"
293,"There should be an adult filter option to block unsuitable subjects for kids"
299,"What have you done with this? I no longer get the Main Page when I open this up. Put it back, please."
305,"This app keeps getting worse and worse. Today, without updating the app, I can no longer search Wikipedia for an article! It reports "An error occurred" as soon as I enter a letter in the search field. I stopped the app, cleared data, and restarted the app, same result. For a while now, when I picked on an image in an article I also got the message "An error has occurred". Now I cannot even open an article in the app. It appears that Wikipedia doesn't even test their own app!"
307,"The app doesn't work, I can't search things there. I don't know why"
308,"at his used to be such a wonderful application, until it became less and less functional, until finally it will no longer function on any of my devices. It began when it would not load any images. An uninstall and reinstall fixed that. Then it would no longer load full sized images. Never could fix that. And finally, it will no longer load anything. . Uninstalling, reinstalling no longer fixes that. On our 4 devices in use, all we ever get is 'an error occurred'. Will there ever be a fix?"
316,"I'm facing this problem since 1 month. When ever I want to search something it shows that *an error occurred*. And I have downloaded it a number of times with a hope that it will work but it doesn't. I would have rated it 5 stars bcz sometime it was working fine and I used to read a lot of articles but now don't know why all this is happening. I'm very much disappointed."
320,"First, this app used to run well but now it has problems. It often says no connection when I search something and some images can't be loaded when I click on them for zooming in. Horrible app. Uninstalled it. The web version is million times better."
329,"Wikipedia isn’t a bad organisation. It's really appreciatable. It's website is great. but i have some issue found using this app. the page takes more and more time to load. that's very disgusting, the app wasn’t well developed. i feel buffering. that's why i deducted 3★."
333,"This app is not available in Hindi"
334,"I love Wikimedia, have it on all of my desktops, then I recieve notice for my smart phone, Galaxy 20, that I cannot use this version. I need to figure out why I cannot use this wonderful app."
340,"Keeps crashing after updating"
342,"App is worse than I thought. Better to use Wikipedia via browser."
343,"app is broken on android 11"
354,"???? Why was my account blocked? My ip address is blocked for 2 months. I didn't create an account for myself till date. Please solve this issue???"
359,"Not sure why but I've been blocked from accessing my Wikipedia, I can't reset my password, nor can I make a new account. It keeps saying my ip address has been blocked and I'm confused as to why it's blocked. I can still look things up, but I can't access my account until 2022 or make a new one and I'm not sure why. Until it's fixed, will give a 1 star rating"
360,"Why does wiki say "an error occured. Go back" ? Why doesnt it explain the error ? I reinstalled it and yet got the same thing. Totally doesnt work!!!! Zero stars"
362,"I installed it , and was asked to provide a user name and password. I gave my name and created a password and received a response that it was an incorrect user name or password. I spent all day yesterday trying to sign into several accounts and kept getting the the same thing. I was frustrated with the whole thing. SO I uninstalled your app. I"m fed up with this stuff !"
363,"Ok, I'm not sure why, but it doesn't show the "main article" subheading. For example, if a subheading says Filmography, it doesn't show anything. It should show the main article for that subheading. FIX IT PLEASE! Also everything on the table is aligned to the left for some reason."
365,"When searching, keeps telling me an error ocurred. This started over a month ago and still hasn't been fixed."
368,"I am using Wikipedia from last year but few days ago when every I open Wikipedia it shows blank screen and when i open an article it says an error occurred go back. What should I do ??."
372,"What happened to the map feature, where you could see Wikipedia entries near yours location? It was super useful when traveling, exploring different places or just venturing into a different part of our neighborhood. Why would you guys remove the feature that made the most sense on a mobile version of Wikipedia? Makes no sense."
375,"The app shows "an error occurred" and stops working. Please solve this problem at old devices."
377,"Unlike on the mobile web page, sections aren't collapsed. Scroll until your fingers bleed."
384,"Ok for reading. For editing it is a poor substitute because as far as I have been able to determine it does not let you see the article history or its talk page. Furthermore, it does not truly sync with your full Wikipedia account in that your editing history starts at zero even once you log in."
388,"Seems to have stopped working. Cannot view any content anymore. Please help to fix. Used to be 5/5 star rating."
391,"The app is nice to read articles offline, but to save them as text or export to read with TTS, or even select all to share, are all not present and cripple this app, making it a dead end for people who collect information for later reference. It is better for me to use Firefox, select all, share to file and read it with TTS, copy paste, and work with the information offline, then to be stuck using precious data on Wikipedia app that I can't use anywhere else on my device."
395,"Have a problem in logging in I'm trynna log into my account but it's always 'invalid username or password' Yet everything is correct"
398,"I'm not basing this rating on Wikipedia's political biases. It's annoying that a new search actually opens a new page instead of replacing the current one. I'm deleting the app because it doesn't support "find in page" when viewing. That makes the web browser much more useful than the app. They are adding that function when editing, so the code is already there. It is not implemented to force viewers to scan the whole article."
402,"New update doesn't allow you to have multiple tabs because when you try to change the tab, it always shows an error message. Actually, there have been A LOT of error messages aside from the tab problem. Also, the side table of contents was sacrificed for an "aesthetically pleasing" one that oftentimes doesn't take you to the section you chose. I use to love with app, but recent update severely downgraded."
403,"This is an absolutely amazing app, but it's been greatly worsened by the latest update. The new UI and table of contents are quite bad. They seem to have ditched simplicity for a more "aesthetic" design which is much less practical. This is a five star app if the developers revert back to the prior design which worked well and was in no need of replacement."
404,"There are some good things about this app, like the fact that you can save Wikipedia pages to lists, but I am unable to access them unless I open a page, close all tabs manually, then I can open my history, lists, as well as what should be the launch page, which is a selection of suggested Wikipedia pages, including "because you read"."
406,"Obviously I love Wikipedia, who doesn't. But I am not a fan of the redesign from the latest update. Visually it looks appealing overall, but the slide out menu no longer has an animation, and can not be slid away. It now has to be tapped and as a result that part of the experience feels so much less natural. You know longer actually slide the menu out, a left swipe from the right opens the menu, and a tap on the left closes it"
407,"App is good but the searching ability is not nice and whenever I try to search for any series it just shows me random searches whether than what i ask for . I gave it a 3 star rating because it is very educational and helps me do my home work"
411,"It's fine and very informative, but it tends to not connect to the internet when every other app of mine is, which results in me having to uninstall then reinstall the app. Restting it ("force stop") doesn't work at all, I have to uninstall it every time that problem occurs. Please fix this issue, and maybe I'll rate higher."
415,"It *was* better, but the update(s) have now made it clumsy and difficult-to-navigate. Word to developers: the text runs *right up* to the right-side border and has some left-right movement. I'm constantly sliding the app's pages to the left so that I can read the end of the sentence. It's not looking like it was well-crafted. And the new tabbing: yuk. Somewhat poor in terms of usability. I've seen you guys do better. I know you can. I'm a donor, so maybe give a listen."
417,"All politics related pages are biased. Needed a neutral platform in my app list. Uninstalled this app."
418,"love the app but there is something that bugs me for quite a while. if i am in dark mode (or any other mode execpt the standard light one) all bars or little squares (i.e. bars that display the number of seats of a party in a parliament or those little squares that are used to differentiate parties by color) are completely blank. looks like an easy fix. hopefully you understand what i mean. thanks edit: haven't tried it yet. i fear that my viewing history gets lost(i think it doesnt get synced)"
422,"The little circle to the right that pulls out the contents is extremely inconvenient while scrolling, as others have pointed out, many of us end up dragging on it while swiping up one handedly. An option to move it to the left of the screen might be solve the issue. Also, since around a month or so ago, the app automatically dims images in dark mode, even when image dimming is turned off."
424,"I give this 0 stars because of protected pages that cannot be edited. I hate that. 🙁🙁🙁🙁🙁"
426,"i could never make it to synch my reading lists from the original device where I saved them to other devices. now I changed phone and they are gone. such a shame. I had spent much time collecting those articles. and then the fact that you cannot access the reading lists from a normal browser is a little bit ridiculous....sorry Wikipedia, I love you in general but this app needs improvement. i would love to be able to continue to use it effectively across all platforms and devices."
428,"The newest version (as of May 2019) is practically unusable. Highly frequent crashing, particularly when trying to save an article to the reading list. This forces the app to restart and I end up losing what I was reading. This is VERY annoying, especially considering I hadn't experienced this issue on older versions. Please fix this! The app is otherwise fantastic, but this one issue ruins the whole experience for me."
429,"The Oct. 29 update removed one of essential features of Wikipedia: hierarchical display of the table of contents. As of now, all contents are listed with no reference to which headings are subheadings of other headings. As a result, in long articles the table of contents is of very little use due to its low readability. Please reintroduce hierarchical display in the table of contents. It is a critical feature of navigation and essential for getting an overview of the article."
430,"The app was incredible at one point, but now it has some SERIOUS navigational issues that have rendered it basically broken. The back button no longer works properly, as it immediately takes you back to the featured article rather than the previous page. Getting to the actual home screen of the app is much more difficult than getting to the featured article. Articles will open over previous tabs, rather than opening a new tab. Portals are also essentially broken within the app. Please fix these!"
432,"like login to a bank uninstall"
436,"I dont have control over none of my information i found people hooked up to my social media they have me hooked up to all kind of stuff redirecting all my information im hooked up to a T Mobile Hot spot they have me and my daugther hooked up to live tv and dating site and some other stuff i found for over 10 years."
438,"Latest update not so good. Today's featured article keeps defaulting on top of the home page. Is there any way to suppress this as it is frustrating. Also the floating continue reading bar at the foot the screen is intrusive and takes up space especially on smaller screen. The sliding bar on the right often gets in the way and swiped menu takes up most of the screen width when opened"
443,"I truly love the wikipedia app, but suddenly the crowned feature, the Places tab, is missing from my version. This feature placed nearby articles on an interactive map. It helped me navigate new cities, and turned the world into a museum. I loved it. It's necessary. I can't for the life of me figure out why it'd be removed. A light has been lost in my life, hence the dim star rating. With it, it'd be 5 stars. Without it, only suffering."
445,"There are plenty of issues I could list with this app if I had the time, such as the general design and the questionable navigation, but my bigger concern is that external links absolutely never work through the app because it always says "no app can perform this action", and it's not like there's a way to specify a browser for these."
447,"Takes a lot of time to load and I also noticed a problem in tabs"
448,"Pretty good, excellent. Wish showed more news episodes."
449,"They had it. then they released an update that ruined it. then they fixed again. now they ruined it again. whenever I try to go back a page to a previous article I was reading, it instead kicks me to the front page, and I have to go through my history to get back to the article I wanted. this is clunky and annoying. I will improve my rating if and when this is fixed"
452,"Most of the time it doesn't load images. I have the setting enabled. I think it's related to the prefer offline setting."
453,"Rating for the app, not for wikipedia as a whole. Good: 1. Offers easy navigation panel for articles. Bad: 1. The app loses internet connectivity for no apparent reason, even when other apps can connect to internet. 2. The pages do not keep the information offline. Technically, no use of such app. You can better live with a Web Browser."
454,"It always say "your IP address is block bla bla bla" I'm so annoyed"
455,"I had been using my Galaxy S7 for the last 3 years and the Wikipedia app worked great on it. However, I am blind with very little vision and my S7 crashed so I replaced it with a Pixel 3a XL. Every time I try to share an article, I get a message saying "direct share not available". I'm trying to find information on this but it has just been a problem as to why I can't share anymore with Wikipedia? Can anyone help with this issue so I can share links through text, email, or even Facebook apps?"
458,"The Wikipedia app is not good. It lacks very basic functionality and doesn't work the way it should. Reading articles? Works fine if you've got an internet connection. But editing? Oh well. Edits that you have just made won't show. It appears as if you didn't edit anything. Very annoying and unhandy editing interface, that can make you delete entire sections by accident. And virtually everything that you do (for example, Special:Watchlist) requires an external web browser. Good job, Wikimeda."
459,"A nicely designed app with a major flaw: it's sloooow. A wiki page that opens in 1s on my phone's browser takes around 30 seconds in this app."
463,"Very, very useful, especially for those who can be online only for some minutes each time. It still lacks in design concept. Otherwise, there is also a lot to improve. As an example, it does not automatically download and keep inline article images. I really love that this application even exists, I would love to see it improve as it deserves."
465,"I use the app every day, but they keep making ill-advised changes to the UI. Nobody needs smooth-scrolling during "find-in-page", it just zooms up and down awkwardly while you're typing. Also the table of contents swiping in from the right is fine, but it's way too sensitive--I keep swiping in the TOC by accident while scrolling vertically by *slightly* moving right-to-left."
466,"Here's another example of it's not broken, dont fix it. Regarding the interface changes, it's a mobile app. Why would you move the new tab button to the top left, and the open in new tab to the bottom left? It's not that I'm too lazy to reach a little further with my finger, but why would you move something that was in a convenient location to one that's isnt? I usually dont update my apps unless I have to and decided to, and regret it. It's not a huge deal, it just doesnt make sense to me. (Unless the developer had a smartphone with a small screen and is a lefty)"
470,"I love the Wikipedia app except the recent update has made it much more difficult to use. The new tab format is poorly placed at the bottom of the screen in a floating window. I accidentally clicked on it constantly. Was there any usability testing done? Please change it back."
477,"Terrible the world's largest encyclopedia but we remove all informative information on our site. The style of Wikipedia is old and needs to be updated to be more modern and they need to stop deleting pages all the time if they should be trying to add more pages not remove them."
478,"There is an issue with external links & lists & categories. This app is pretty good for the most part. I love offline reading, I love how easy this is to use. But, I often use categories from Wikipedia, but this app had removed all pages from Category:[Whatever] lists. It makes the app harder to use. As well, I often check out external links, to check primary sources, or just read original articles. But those links are either broken or disabled, and I can't change this feature in settings."
479,"The new design is horrible, particularly the new swipe left menu. The text is too small and far apart and those ugly circle guides are awful. It doesn't pull out smoothly but in one motion and you can't swipe right to get rid of it but you have to tap on the small part of the screen that's still left. Awful."
481,"it's saying "we are sorry, Wikipedia had experienced an error and was terminated. would you like to START OVER or QUIT? " this is the app which is use the most and now this is happening, I want the customer service to look into the issue and fix the problem . I would have given it 5 stars but not anymore"
482,"i still have the 2017-10 version of the app because I'm on an older phone with jellybean. so recently it's been saying an error has occured whenever i try to load any page even ones i have saved. idk how that happened, it's sad that it's unusable, but it was a great app while i had it. the ui actually trained me for using firefox instead of chrome, which again i have jellybean & thereby became a safety requirement. thank you for your work, it helps the world."
484,"WAS great app. Now no where near great. I USED to have around 60 to 70 articles on my reading lists. Just checked today, and apparently they decided to DELETE ALL OF THEM with a recent app update. Because just before latest update they were all fine. App is great for looking up info, BUT I can no longer trust createing what are essentially bookmarks for article I want to go back to, so it has rendered the aop useless to me now. And no way to get back."
488,"Good, when you visit something it saves. But I also need a better offline version of this where I could browse without internet even if it requires too much storage if also possible"
491,"kindly add feature that user can optionally add "PIN" number/passcode and optionally enable the feature that on current device one will need to enter the 4 digit PIN number to access the "wikipedia" app. This is useful for protecting from someine seeing our list of bookmarks ,when we give mobile to other persons for use. For example see this feature in "omni notes", "telegram" etc apps"
493,"I'd rather use a web browser. I like to use find in page a function in a web browser. I thought I'd try your app again but I still think I'd rather use the web browser."
494,"The newest redesign is really bad. You can't close multiple tabs in one go: every time you land in the next tab. And the overview of an article is maybe prettier (...not to my taste, but some may like it), but it isn't easy to read."
498,"Was brilliant, really. But the new swipe left contents menu is horrible. It's clunky, doesn't always swipe out the first time and doesn't swipe back. You have to press on the tiny sliver of remaining screen to get rid of it. It wasn't broke..."
499,"Why can't you give a option to disable hyperlinks. Blue links are distracting while reading."
500,"The app is not as good as the web browser version, since the app does not show all of the info about a subject and is missing key links/heading to get to that info. IE: After searching for a television season, with multiple seasons, I was unable to go specifically to that season's page to see each individual episode, even though on the web browser version, there was a link by each season in the Season List Heading, which does not show up in the app version, therefore I will uninstall the app."
502,"Was really good before I installed the new update (while enrolling for the Samsung One UI Beta). I am using the 4th beta release, and the app says "You'll be able to share with people here after you make contact in communication apps". What does this mean? This is the only app that tells this. Can copy the link, share on most of the usual messaging services.. only Android Beam, Facebook as newsfeed, Gmail, LinkedIn and Bluetooth transfer. Please provide a fix."
505,"Not very easy to navigate, but still nice to see the development of an app to suit the online service. :)"
507,"I love this app, but an annoying issue came in. When I was trying to sign up, it doesn't consider all of my tries of creating an username valid. I searched for inappropriate username characteristics, and yet, these usernames that I tried creating aren't even any of these. It always considers it invalid ALL THE TIME!!! Pls help me... Then I will give you five stars. Again, I love this app."
510,"for the latest update: after the new update, it can't open the images of articles. all I can see are grey boxes in the article. Very annoying and frustrating. Please restore the older version. It had an excellent user interface. Now its completely ruined."
511,"It had been very good until the last week or so when black mode stopped working right when viewing articles (as opposed to the home screen). Articles are showing up with very strange formatting with a white background and light blue font. forrmatting is OK when in light mode but that's hard or my old eyes."
515,"Please add listening text option also instead of just reading it and make the black theme just a little lighter or dark theme a little bit darker. It would be really great."
519,"Very limited compared to the normal web site. Hard to imagine why people would use this. The only thing it seems to offer is offline pages, but I can't imagine why I would want to read the same page again and again. I would rather just use the normal web page and get the full function."
520,"App is great and handy but noticed a bug. If you go to a link that is just another link the link is not shown. For example if you go to H.P. Lovecraft's wikipedia page and go to the bibliography part there is nothing on the app but when viewing via a browser there is a full link to the bibliography page. It seems to do this on all articles"
521,"The app is just pointless, only have 2 interesting things save articles and dark mode in all the other aspects is better to use the web page, in the app you can't even zoom."
523,"Removed Primary Feature. I used to love this app, I used it to discover nearby points of interest and to learn more about local history. This feature worked by overlaying Wikipedia information onto a map which you could interact with. When I looked up support and found related article it says that they removed this feature due to privacy concerns people had. Doesn't it make more sense to either toggle the feature based on allowed app privileges or even hosting a parallel app with this feature"
524,"The new navigation is useless since the new method requires scrolling down to it. It disappears as soon as you remove your finger from it. The cursor is always present and covers text, so you have to constantly have to scroll to read the article."
527,"Quite Good. Sometimes pages do not completely load. So I resort to using chrome."
529,"I prefer using a web browser so I can keep lists open on separate tabs to compare. When switching tabs in the app, they keep closing. Can't really see any benefits to using app. Also, editing on mobile is too annoying due to size. Otherwise fine, I guess?!"
533,"I think the app flows really well. However, im also a Wikipedia editor and - despite the fect that it has the ability to edit - I can't seem to edit on this app. It would easily be 5 stars if I could, because the edit feature is smooth and easy. It just breaks when you go to publish."
535,"The offline reading option is not working. Reading lists are showing as downloaded and even say for example "6 out of 6 articles available for offline viewing" and yet when you have no data or WiFi the articles won't load saying the are not available for offline. I have the latest update. Super frustrating"
536,"I'm sure that many good people would like to contribute articles, add to articles and add pictures and citations and so forth, but they cannot. Why? -It's just too complicated to do so if you ask me. The Wiki mark up language is a nightmare and was designed in the nineties and the so-called help pages are hopeless. People need to create and edit in plain text, and not have to learn a complex and obsolete mark up language for perhaps just one instance of editing or article writing."
537,"As many have stated, since yesterday the app has not been working properly. It takes a while to load and won't connect to the internet when all the other apps are working just fine. I usually have no issues with it and seldom write reviews but I would like this to be sorted out asap."
541,"Hyperlinks open in the app just fine, and most content renders correctly. However, the search feature is frequently broken; I get a "cannot connect to Wikipedia" error even though articles accessed by other routes load just fine. Also, there must be a better way to embed large tables."
542,"Please improve offline mode, Many time when i do not have internate, its offline mode saved page shows error and page do not open. Generaly its offline mode open without internate, but many time i have seen it shows error, plese sir please improve it please, becase yhe internate is very costely in nepal, plese sir improve it. Plese.."
547,"Please change the contents sidebar back, seems too sensitive somehow, keep catching it and losing my place. Also, the white tab on the right is just annoying and really doesn't serve a worthwhile purpose. This app often changes just for the sake of it."
549,"Android dark or black theme no longer converts background to dark grey/black. Was working fine 2 days ago but somethings killed the dark themes on all my devices so unusable for my vision problems. Showing white text on a white page, so illegible and inaccessible to those who need it to reaf rather than it being a luxury."
550,"Good app, but sidebar navigation needs to be fixed. Feels completely unresponsive, often it won't open out when swiping and can't be swiped closed. It used to be fine but this latest redesign has abandoned material design in favour of something that's more frustrating to use."
553,"Wikipedia used to be a pretty good online encyclopedia. They seem to be signing on far-left activists as moderators these days. Every right-leaning personality is suddenly "far-right". Every source of information they disagree with is conspiracy theory source. Pro-Life is "anti-abortion" (despite abortion being only one of many issues Pro-Life addresses.) Now Wikipedia is just another cesspool of unreliable, heavily-biased misinformation."
558,"I have been using Wikipedia for almost 6 years now but not just casually, intensly and will no longer use it ever again. Why? Well quite simply because your editors are on the whole not objective and as impartial and neutral as one would expect a Encyclopaedia to be. In fact a good amount of Wikis articles concerning the politics or "controversial" subjects are blatantly far left and draging people who are not American into their political nonsense. You need to clean up your political bull$#!t."
559,"More Spyware. Like most every app is demanding spyware permissions that don't have anything to do with why I wanted the app in the first place. Sad for Wikipedia, as I have donated to them in years past, but can no longer support their corrupt direction."
560,"Please add colourful texts with new features"
562,"Good app but still need to include the sorting functionality when it comes to tables of data. It needs to have the ability to sort by column just like the Wikipedia on desktop browsers. Also images aren't being displayed. It's just a grey box."
563,"I hate to give this app a bad review, because I really love Wikipedia, but there is no option for "find" in page. I just opened this enormous page with tons of content, and I was looking for mention of one particular animal, and couldn't just search for it on that page. I'll still use Wikipedia, but I'll use the site going forward."
564,"I spent an hour trying to find a username that wasn't already taken or wasn't too similar to an existing one. I was unsuccessful so gave up. Even "Is this unique enough?" was rejected as it was too similar to "isthisuniqueenough". After a break to calm down I found a unique username only for it to be rejected on the grounds that my IP address had already tried to access 6 accounts in the last hour. This app is clearly having problems."
565,"This apo requires the permission "Run At Startup". Wikipedia is not a system app an therefore has no reason to require this privacy invasive permission. Please allow your users to decide when and if we would like an app constantly running in the background using memory and battery. I really expected better of Wikipedia."
569,"The app is fine when it works. However, there are times when it won't connect to the internet even though other internet based apps are operating just fine. During such times I can access Wikipedia on a browser, but not the app."
570,"From few days it is writing "an unknown error occurred ""
573,"Not working in my mobile. Appear message as 'DNS_PROBE_FINISHED_NXDOMAIN'"
574,"Used to be great, but now keeps losing internet connection. The problem is the Wikipedia app, not my device or network connection, as evidenced by the fact that I can successfully post this review but not complete my Wikipedia look-up which is open concurrently in another tab."
576,"Don't understand why the pull-out index presentation was changed. The new one does not show the heading tree structure, and has spacing that allows fewer entries to be seen without scrolling. Please bring the old one back."
577,"Downright awful user experience. The mobile site is a cleaner and faster read. For example, the "summary" box under a person picture is missing. This box contains quick info like age, date of term, when drafted by a professional team. I'm deleting the app. LOVE the site though"
579,"Really is usually an amazing app. Love the simplicity and how clean it is. But the new table of contents drawer is horrible. The old one wasn't as cool looking but way simpler and informative. This new one you have to scroll way to much."
581,"One of my favorite things is the random article button, which I can't find anywhere in this newest version. The overall navigating of the app has also been degraded in the update."
582,"Recent update apparently killed most of the "Share" options! Huh!! I used to Share to Diigo all the time. Now I have four options, down from perhaps a dozen or more: Share to Messaging, Drive, Bluetooth (?!?), or copy the link to clipboard. Guess it's time to uninstall this app?"
583,"It desperately needs to do something about the countries that block wikipedia. It's basically unusable. If it had a built in vpn it'd solve everything. Please make a note of this. You'll only help people by so doing. Until then, it's a 3 star app for me. I should've given it lower since I can't use it at all but hey."
584,"You can use this app or ANY SEARCH ENGINE with fewer extra steps. Gave three stars for effort, even though the resources spent on developing this app could've been put to much better uses, like servers, for instance. Don't mean to be rude or overly clitical but that's the truth, at least in my humble opinion. Thanks for existing, Wikipedia!"
585,"gets worse with every update, like every app out there. latest piss-off feature: if you search for a word in an article, you don't jump to the result but you're forced to watch several seconds of the app scrolling through the article. i bet some shitskins came up with this crappy feature."
586,"Been using it for years buy sadly it crashed a few days ago & not loading."
587,"I'm right handed, which means I scroll with my right index finger. Which means I am constantly activating that fast scroll gizmo that covers half the screen and I never use. How about an option to switch it to the left hand side or turn it off entirely? I will then give five stars because I use this all the time."
590,"I dont know why they changed the tab layout. Its horrible now. The UI WAS FINE. LEAVE WELL ENOUGH ALONE. Now you have a stupid white tab to the right all the time that covers text and is bright as hell at night. Revert please, this update was not needed whatsoever."
593,"It suddenly won't work anymore It's saying can't search offline"
596,"Please fix. Can't view articles properly thanks."
598,"At first it provided information,now it just acts like a fake news site full of biases and useless information...moreover it has turned into another political tool"
604,"Application is good. Need little more improvements. *In widget, 'today's featured page' is not changing automatically. Today's featured page should be changed automatically in the home screen widget. Please update. Thanks"
606,"This was the perfect Wikipedia app till recent update. Every time you search something new it'll open a new page and honestly is annoying no need for that. Go back to how it was. We're here to read and find out new things not have 100 windows open for no reason."
607,"I really hate this new feature, that opens a new tab every single time I searched something. EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. In fact, I think I would not be remiss in stating that removing this annoyance will greatly improve my enjoyment of this app, by a YUUUGE margin P/S : Please remove it"
609,"Wikipedia is a Convenient Application that comes in Hand whenever you're Arguing with someone about a Fact or topic, and you need to prove them wrong by looking it up with this App. However, the overall Design and Layout needs some Improvement. Other than that it's Good to Use."
610,"It's not good when you force notifications, and that notification takes you to an external website. Thanks for the response but I had just updated the app on my tablet before that happened."
612,"New update significantly decreased the amount of tabs on the screen and made them much bigger, and the new sliding table of contents takes up quite a bit of space. Makes navigation clunkier, would enjoy a revert."
614,"Can't register because I keep getting an error message saying that I've been blocked. I'm new, using a brand new phone, and not trying to connect via WiFi so I don't know why I would be blocked. Guess I'll just access the info that I want through Google."
616,"I have been using Wikipedia for some time, but recently if i want to search, it tells me an error occurred. Please fix this"
617,"Whatever happened to the ability to download photos? The option is still there, and when you click it the item shows as downloaded, but it never shows up. I even tried uninstalling and then reinstalling the app, but that didn't fix the issue."
620,"Cannot access Wikipedia by clicking the app icon. Can only access by googling an article and clicking the link. Only then does the app open"
623,"Updated this app as well as signed up for a Wikipedia account today, after which I have found that all articles that I have saved in the past three years are now gone. Disappointed, somewhat."
628,"I can't share links to my clipboard anymore. What is up with that? I also don't like the redesign opening the view multiple tabs switches from the right instead of the top"
629,"Overall the app is okay. However, if I close all the tabs, then try tapping the plus button to start a new tab, the app closes. This is a frustrating bug."
630,"Good app to read Wikipedia articles, although some content (like long mathematical formulas) is cut off on small screens. Unfortunately there is no option to not save the history or previous searches."
632,"i did love the app but hate the arrow icon that is on the right side of the screen as my hand keeps activating it and the page contents keep coming up. please could this be removed? there is already an icon on the bottom of the screen to do the same thing"
634,"In Chrome, when I click a Wikipedia article link, it doesn't open in Chrome. Instead, the app opens. But I don't want that. If I wanted to be in app, I would have been there. I want to be in Chome in Desktop view."
637,"I want to be able to tts this. It has to be accessible in audio. It doesn't matter if it's only beta. I want to have a random article reading list with infinite articles."
643,"I'd love to love it but it has a nasty habit of telling me it can't download pages because my device is offline when it absolutely isn't. if it weren't for that it'd get five stars."
646,"Making an account is so hard. It always say I he captcha wrong when I got it right 🤷🏻‍♀️ as a result of failing the captcha 4 times, the app banned me from making an account because apparently, I've been trying to "make multiple accounts in the last 24hrs" but calm down, I'm just trying to get the captcha right for one account 🙄"
648,"You can't find serching word in saved list by tag or similar name without knowledge of first name. Redirection and tags aren't work. Вы не можете найти слово для поиска в сохраненном списке по тегу или подобному имени без знания первого названия. Перенаправление и теги не действуют."
651,"Latest update has a "Continue reading" prompt which is of no use to me (I'd add to a list if I wanted to come back to an article), takes up screen space and I can find no way to remove it."
652,"It doesn't allow me to sign up What the hell done with this app It tells that I can't sign up with my ip address what should I do... 😡😡😡😡"
653,"Cant able to join Wikipedia group due to incomplete visible of captcha code"
655,"I love this app, but since the update, the dark themes are completely unusable. I can only read things in the white theme and I like to read as I fall asleep. Sadly I'm going to have to find an alternative 😩"
656,"Uninstalled due to glitches with themes making pages unreadable & the article pages themselves becoming unreadable in parts even on light theme because of text normally at bottom of article overlaying portions of article and making them unreadable and developer not even addressing this problem this time."
660,"It's a very informative app of engaging regular readers. I just love it's UI. I am giving it 3 stars because it is full of bugs like it hangs sometimes! Please look into this at rhe earliest possible as it is ruining the experience."
661,"Has been increasingly glitchy over past several weeks, culminating in an error message when I type the first letter of search term. I cleared search history--no impovement. App will go to links when tapped, but search is now nonoperational."
664,"like this app very much. Please adding fiture read alone with text to speech engine when we tap the paragraph. This will help many people to read without see the text."
665,"All of a sudden i literally cant search for anything. It was telling me that the search engine is busy. And now if i simply type a single letter into the search bar, even without pressing search, it gives me an error code."
666,"As i feel many political parties' family which was correctly stated earlier are now wrongly edited. Example: Nehru and his ancesters info seems deleted/modified/updated incorrectly. These many days i and several others trusted wikipedia and other internet sources truely; which has been shattered now. UNINSTALLING this app and REMOVE WIKIPEDIA from my Home Page."
670,"very bad, no articles, no info, just a whole lot of useless instructions, come on you guys are better than this !!!? 3rd try, dont get anythimg but a lot of imstructions, no articles or info, thought Id get some news, didnt even ask what I wanted ?? A real disappointment..."
671,"Even though it still has the same content (obviously), the last design update made the app significantly less usable. It just removed a ton of features and worsened the UX."
675,"Nice Idea, but SLOW. Using my browser and going to the Wiki site is better for me. Nice bells and whistles, but I can do without."
678,"Articles are frequently unreadable, due to the "About this article" and "read more" sections overlapping and cutting off the bottom of the page."
680,"get rid of that awful button on the side for fast scrolling. everytime i read an article i accidently touch it making me loose where i was. bloody annoying and a major fail. bring back the swipe feature. i am not enjoying your mobile version any longer. deleted. went back to web based."
681,"I have been able to create an account. However, I had to use the apple app on another device to do so. Fix the android version so that it does not show an error to all usernames when signing up."
683,"Use this all the time but I cannot Log In as I forgot my password. When I click the Forgot Password link it says my IP has been blocked and cannot retrieve or reset my password. The Help Desk is useless. Wikipedia is always asking for donations but it is so user UNfriendly why would anyone give money to this mess?!!!"
689,"This app really needs fixing. After you view a couple of pages you'll get a message saying the internet connection has been lost even though all your other apps will still be connected."
692,"Wikipedia doesn't work correctly when I'm logged in. The default start page won't load when I'm logged in. When I'm logged out it works okay. Otherwise it's just like using the website."
693,"Not terrible but, for me, it has important disadvantages over the website, especially the lack of collapsible contents on longer articles. I'll continue to use the website, thanks."
695,"I quite like the web interface for mobile of Wikipedia lot more than this app. The quick & brief info panel is always minimized in the app & it is the thing i only look for while opening a Wikipedia page at first."
696,"Useless. Rarely works and often stops loading saying my internet is not available. Strange all other apps working as well as my streaming of sky go and spotify. Must just be that the wikipedia app is garbage. Avoid."
697,"There is some bug concerning dark mode wherein the text has a white highlight to it. please fix this at the earliest as the dark mode feature was a boon for Wikipedia, please don't let it become a bane now."
703,"Saving for offline later does not work. In a reading list I will click it, then if I'm in airplane mode they won't load and will tell me to add to a reading list, which I have already done."
706,"Pictures don't load just shows a grey box where pictures should be."
707,"the list of topics currently open now isnt a list, its shows line a bunch of pages, and is much slower to scroll through. this really sucks. i want to roll the app back. never should have updated."
708,"possibly a good app but can't create an account because it seems any possible combination of letters is either taken or 'too similar' then after a few tries they lock you out. not worth the hassle"
709,"The app does not display png graphics used on Wikipedia pages. (Samsung Tab S5e). They appear blank. Conversely, viewing in a browser shows the pictures. The app is unusable on this device."
715,"Ever since the latest update it made it impossible to search anything. It always says that an "unknown error has occurred." Its worthless free or not if you cant look something up on the app."
716,"The new updates are poor. The opening picture doesn't load and deleting multiple tabs is difficult. The navigation is no longer as crisp."
717,"Very useful app but the latest version opens a new tab with every search - totally unnecessary and means the app quickly fills up with dozens of open tabs."
721,"Why have you added the "run at startup" permission? I use this app infrequently and do not need it running in the background all the time. I can decide when it needs to run."
723,"Great until last update. Automatically opens new articles in a new tab, at least give us the option to turn this off. Also crashes more often"
725,"when i try to create an account, it always says the username is unavailable, no matter what i type, making me unable to create an account. other than that, the app works fine."
726,"Was good until a recent update changed it to where every time you search for something it automatically opens it in a new tab. It's frustrating and annoying."
728,"Could have been great, but I get constant errors with many of the articles I downloaded to read offline. Frustrating - just use your browser because this client sucks."
730,"It's really a bogus app because i can't log in. The no. of times i am filling details at the end it says your username is incorrect or you have used yours email id more than 3 times."
731,"I warn Wikipedia, how dare you to update that the Sushant singh Rajput has died by hanging, or it's suicide. how you can say? Have you any strong proof of suicide? Have Wikipedia seen the hanging body? If you have any pictures of hanging send me please. Who told you to update? the Sushant singh Rajput has died by the hanging, or it is suicide. how you can declare this incident as suicide, I want satisfaction answer, otherwise I will file a complaint (FIR) against Wikipedia."
734,"The latest update is causing me big problems. Server is too busy on many occasions and now getting an error code when i want to search. Please fix as this is one of the all time greatest apps"
737,"What's fixed? What's new? Openness & Transparency please. Lead by example and keep your "What's new" section on the Play store properly up-to-date."
738,"Going a bit downhill, don't like how it keeps opening new tabs and there is apparently no way to disable or dismiss the "continue reading" pop up."
739,"Share not working anymore. "You'll be able to share with people here after you make contact in communication apps". Useless so have to uninstall. Worked 8 years but not anymore. Shame."
740,"minor bug fixes ???. in the 80s i paid $200 for 4meg of ram now they waist our time on MINOR updates with 5.6meg . WHAT FOR. no wonder my phone runs out of memory. stop waisting our time and resources guy's just try to improve the APP not justify your jobs"
744,"90% of the time images in articles don't load. No way to find the cause - uninstall then reinstall temporarily fixed the issue. Switching internet source didn't help."
745,"The app doesn't allow me to save articles to read them offline. The articles simply don't show up after saving them. Galaxy s8"
749,"It behaves like a left wing portal. Many articles are one sided and show only one side of the story. Also many facts have been hidden to support a propaganda"
750,"For the last two weeks or so when I searched something it would say "search is busy" then that stopped, but now it says "an error has occured""
759,"The latest version is very hard to navigate between tabs, the app spontaneously closes when closing all the tabs, not going back to the homepage."
764,"This app can not give you the info you need.If someone searches for something it gives you something else. Ohhh,I wish you could make this app better .😿😾👎👎👎👎👎"
766,"Room for improvements - This app can provide multiple back ground color options say like kindle.. Secondly, the app should override the screen lock time.."
767,"At first i was very excited to get the app because i use the website alot and then when i create a account apparently my ip address is blocked even though i did nothing wrong and this was the very first time i even tried to create a account."
768,"30 Dec 2019. The app has started its bug that the 12 Dec update had fixed. Every search now errors with "An Error Has Occured. Go Back". Was working properly up to 29 Dec 2019."
769,"Im still for the 3rd time having issues with certain pages freezing up for several seconds. Can this be fixed? Is my review even veing read? Otherwise very informative."
772,"Can't get app working properly, can't connect to internet many times, not the internet connection problem on my tablet, because everything else working smoothly, only this not"
773,"So inferior to the website version, idk why anyone would use the app. Can't support video like the website, and omits a lot of things from the website main page. Not the worst app, but considering the website, this app is completely useless"
776,"Disgusting experience.. unable to make new account. Unnecessarily blocked from making new account. There's no meaning or reason to block my IP address to make a new account. Disaster Wiki App!!"
781,"Unable to initiate on Samsung A10, simply says "We're sorry, the wikipedia app has experienced an error and was terminated. Would you like to start over or quit?""
791,"The latest update is totally frustrating. Though turned off in the customised feed, Today's Featured Article and In the News keep always appearing!"
795,"It seems since the recent update, this app keeps saying ERROR OCCURRED. I am unable to use the app. Please fix it."
796,"App not visible on homescreen although shows as installed on the, "Play Store"."
797,"use to be the best app cannot imagine my life without it but after last update can not even open 1 article.. keeps on crashing evrytime i search for sonething.. sort it out and i will change the rating if cant there are so many alternatives available.."
803,"Everything is fine but I was stuck in entering captcha. No matter how many times I enter it correctly it says wrong captcha. Please solve this issue."
805,"Most editors are arrogant. They remove articles arbitrarily and misbehave in talks. Cited articles are removed on the pretext of neutrality conditions of Wikipedia. These senior editors deem them as paid edits. Extremely biased and it is worthless to waste time in Wikipedia. There was one instance where a user removed an article and when questioned, the concerned person replied "I don't care about what complaints you have" I don't get any salary to edit or write here. We do a charity. High Bias"
806,"i downloaded this app because a game called terraria, so i could browse through items quicker than on chrome. So tried "terraria accessories" and it comes up with non related bs. Ok, next i tried searching for Terraria .. voila, its there! i open it and clicked on the "items" external link .. it come up explaining what items are in general ... waste of space, uninstalled."
809,"A dependable app. A trusted app for all purposes,it gives you answers of any topic that you may inquire. I recommend it to both academics,professionals,politicians,military and any field you may request."
810,"Useless. Keeps saying my phone is offline even though it's connected to wifi and 4G network, other apps are connecting to the internet perfectly fine. Tried reinstalling and it made no difference."
813,"Dreadful. Most internet providers have a block on editing and won't even let you open an account. Then they have the cheek to ask for money! Utterly beyond belief..."
