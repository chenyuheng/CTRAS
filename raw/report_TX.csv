1,"This app is so bright it hurts. You're trying to read, write and relax, but the blank color scheme reminds me more of the sun hitting my face at 6am than of me relaxing while browsing.  This app doesn't have some sort of front page like imgur has for example, instead all we get is the ""discover"" feature which only promotes bland, vague and uninteresting posts with no personality. Just look at it right now! Where are the people sharing relatable stories, or video game strategies, or book or tv show reviews or something? All the posts featured there are just... unattractive, to say the least. And it's the only source of new content there is, otherwise you have to look it up manually.  There are no set categories or tags, instead you make them up and unless people type them up exactly like you did they won't see your post, which is counterintuitive and discourages finding new posts or bloggers.  People can disapprove or even edit your comments. That is twisted, discourages freedom of speech and opinion sharing and even allows people to literally put words in your mouth by changing your original comment to whatever they want.  You can't dislike posts or comments, so the voting system is pointless. You might think otherwise because Twitter and Vine have no downvotes,  but they promote discovery of new content in various ways, while WordPress does not.  The search bar doesn't work. I've tried finding my own posts with the exact same title they have and they don't appear.  All of these factors make it feel deserted and lacking of a community, and discourage new users of getting into writing or reading on WordPress. Also there used to be a eay to add a black outline to images; a necessity when the background is white.",,
2,"Problems, Problems, Problems! ------------ First when I installed the app & got some maps, they would disappear from the phone after each re-boot. So, I wrote to the developer. No reply after a month, I wrote back. No reply after two weeks. ------------- Next I uninstalled & re-installed the app (for the 12th time trying to fix the vanishing maps problem). Now the place in Settings to tell the app where to store the maps is gone. Gone! (The SD is 32 GB and has 31 GB free) I wrote the developer. After a week- no reply. ---------- Uninstall Warning: Each time I uninstalled the app., a large folder (Over 1 GB on mine) was left behind on the phone. One must use a file manager to delete it. --------- I Give Up (Which is too bad because this app is easy to use.) UPDATE- As shown below, the someone from the developer company posted suggestions. I had already tried (multiple times) what is suggested in the links the person posted. I also had already sent e-mails to the address shown. I will try one more time to contact them (because it looks like a fun & easy app). If no luck, I'll have to conclude that my phone and this app just won't play well together. UPDATE- Developer replied to this review and asked me for the name I used to contact them. I won't post my e-mail here. (That's not a comfortable thing to do.) I sent a new e-maill to them. I will update the review & star rating when (if) they reply & tell me how to make this application work.",,

4,"The only use for this app over google is it shows trails and jungle footpaths. After that its 'EFFING USELESS. The pointer spins constantly so you cant tell which way you're facing. It points 180 degrees out and the blue dotted line follows you, ie it can send you back the way you came and not leave your start point blank....so you still think youre going the right way as youre always attached to the dotted line. It should let the pointer move away from the dotted line, then you can see youre off course. If you brush the screen it opens a new dropped pin which then deletes the path you were following. I cant bookmark anything. Theres paths highlighted in red that i didnt add, it constantly directs you to road routes even tho i only want mountain footpaths and have it set to walking. It does work offline for me which is 1 reason not to boot it just yet but its useless to navigate with, i use it just to look for trails. Thankfully im not getting ads cos thailand auto blocks anything that isnt of profit directly to them. You need to disable the info sharing, apparently this app sells info on you 20 times more than other apps",,
5,"Great potential but needs bug fixes Of course, I like the idea of having an off-line map. I downloaded a few of them. They seem fairly accurate, easy to read and have a lot of very useful details by default without decreasing the readability. So from that point of view I would give at least 4 stars. Now it keeps freezing on me if I touch any of the controls Search, Download Maps (I can download only by using the map itself), Settings at the bottom of the screen. Also some details (such as shops and bus stops are missing) and at least in one case a bus stop would show only at a specific scale. So I am only giving 3 stars right now but there is a great potential for an excellent app... PS. And I also like the fact they try to answer most of the reviewers when appropriate!",,
6,"Adds have been added in one of the never versions, don't update if you haven't already! It's a good app, but it's NOT a universal map. It works best if you find your destination address with a browser, as the names in OSM don't always match. Due to size limits, searching by street numbers is not possible and this severely limits your options. The app goes nuts if your GPS is broken, and you can't just follow the route by moving the map with fingers, as popups keep reappearing. Maps.me is best if you just move to points you know in advance, using the best in class bookmark system",,
7,"Routes are unstable. While following proposed route I was requested to turn back and follow a new route.  Missing ""do not download"" option in map diwnload dialog window. Unable to configure localisation of the map directory. Menu bar disappears at random? Navigation proposes routes violating the law and mistakes public roads with field roads.  After update navigation is much worse. No perspective view despite it is enabled in settings. Calculating a route is slow, arrival estimation changed from optimistic (below 4h) to pessimistic (over 8h) for a route Krapkowice-Warszawa (Poland, realistic estimate ca 5h). Rerouting freezes very often.  Figured out how to enable perspective view. I had to disable it, close the app, reopen the app and enable it. I fear of other bugs.",,
8,"Good idea in theory but the interface is way too ham-handed. If I try to set multiple reminders for a task, it seems like it would allow it, but then it discards the second reminder time and only saves the first one. Moving tasks up and down the list doesn't work properly (lags and jitters). Tapping refresh puts them back in their original order making re-sequencing them pointless. Which brings me to another point: refresh has to be tapped constantly to see changes that you make. I created a habit and it seemingly disappeared right after hitting save and wouldn't appear until I refreshed. Also, how do I hear the theme song? I can change it in the settings but tapping each option simply changes which one is active. How am I supposed to know which theme I want if I can't preview it? Another problem is the tutorial: tapping the menu items at the bottom didn't always activate each sections tutorial. For example, I tapped on To-do and created some items, then went to Rewards, saw that tutorial, went back to To-do, and then the app decided to display the tutorial for To-do. Making tasks, habits and goals like an RPG is a great idea. But honestly, I think most people would get frustrated at this clunky interface and just give up after 5 or 10 minutes like I did.",,
9,"I was a bit lost on a tropical island's hill. Used it to find the right path back. Recent version seemed to be acting perversely, sending one to slip road to exit motorway only to rejoin it. Also no option for using motorway if available. Not good. Also it would be useful to be able to have waypoints and preferred routes and types of roads to avoid. Updated version now doesn't bring up saved favourites when planning route when tapping on To button. Another feature absent is any indication of the name of the road you are on, or, often, the junction numbers on motorways. The maps do not always show road names as well, or if they show up, the names will vanish when you zoom.",,
10,"Has some UI usability issues. While doing a search on a street, it's very unresponsive when I press on the street that has already come up in the search results.  Also, no way to enter a street number. Which seems pretty basic and shocking that it doesn't allow user to specify a street number!   Disappointing. I just spent 20 minutes trying to enter in the address of a location.   Suggest you hire some UI designers and product managers to do a better job redesigning this app, to be user friendly and make it easy for users to do simple things, like actually entering in an address!  In response to Developer's ""fixing"" the 2 missing EXAMPLE addresses I listed, that's like a drop  in the ocean. The problem is NOT simply that it couldn't locate the 2 EXAMPLE addresses I listed. The problem is deeper. It was unable to properly locate an arbitrary, VALID, address. This is something Google Maps can do EASILY.   Based on this rather GLARING defect, I think this largely makes this app unusable for general purpose navigation..",,
11,"Samsung Tab 7,0 This review was done after using the app to leave Atlanta airport. **I do not recommend a buy on this app' but stick with the free version as the  major difference is the ability to search on this one, but it is not good and you essentially have the same features on both, free & Pro, with out it.  MapWithMe Pro has a nice mapping interface it works great on my 7.0, but *The app doesn't do navigation or street address search but merely shows you as a dot on a map which is the same as the free version. *The search feature add to the Pro version is very limited: not worth the money. * The Samsung 7.0 comes with, Latitude, for free and gives you the ability to download maps for offline uses and work just as good.  What I would like to see is point to point navigation and a more in depth search . If you drive into a GPS black out area a offline mapping system is nice to have limited uses to get you back on track.",,
12,"Offline reading is a huge draw for me but I don't know if it's the android app or what but the gui is completely obtuse. Impossible to get to main menu and read my saved articles, I have scoured everywhere. All I can do is save pages to my lists but not read them. One time when I updated my install it worked but no button returns me to main menu. Pressing back exits the app. Please I've searched what in Christ's name is this?",,
13,"Updated review: I have used this app for half a year, against my better judgement.  I have sent eighteen bug reports to the devs.  Little.  I could easily send another twenty more, but it isn't worth the time.  This is simply the most bugged piece of software I have ever used.  The avatars are hideous.  The only good thing that this app has going for it is the clean user interface, and a clever separation of the to-do list into three sections.  It is missing some pretty basic to-do list functionality.  The game loads slowly, and doesn't work without an internet connection.  Some of the bugs I've experienced: Reminders pop up on random days, no matter how many times I readjust their settings. Constantly having trouble connecting to the servers. Visual bugs: shows one item, but you get some other item.  Newly equipped main weapon won't show on avatar until app restarted. Progress bars for quests spaz out every time you open the page. Keyboards won't go away once they pop up. And the list goes on and on...",,
14,"Poor! Almost not adapted for a touch device! - UI very unresponsive to clicks, uncertain whether registered! No immediate touch-down response, you just realize that your click was registered as the page refreshes, which may take 1-3 secs, within that time no UI feedback. - Chapters by default hidden (I prefer all chapters of the article open for quick scrolling and visual scanning + a button/action for bringing up an index for jumping. And this index shall remember its position if brought up later on. Having to open all chapters manually (effort) disrupts reading experience. Finger scrolling less mind distraction - Browsing history: Back jumps to top of article, not to last reading position! + Search with autocompletion - but with no abstract. + Switch the current article to other available language - but no setting to only show preferred languages. - No search function for other than the default language (even if you just switched to an article in another language) - No function ""search text within this article"". - No font size in/de-crease. - No special image functions (show fullscreen, then zoom in/out, save to)  Summary: Look for the competitor Wikipanion on iOS to see a real good mobile Wikipedia client!",,
15,"Effectively useless for cycle routing. I downloaded this to get cycle routing which Google maps doesn't offer in Central America. Maps.Me does do cycle routing but it's effectively useless. First, it only offers you one route to your destination, so if you were thinking about taking another road, too bad, maps.me will not show you how long that road might be. You only get the one suggestion and no others, and no way to make it give you other options.  Second, there's clearly a compulsion by the app to avoid anything it thinks is a highway at all costs. So you end up with totally bizarre and out of the way routes when there's a direct road from you to your destination. This avoidance of highways would be ok if you were given more than one route to choose from, or you could turn off the 'avoid highways' preference. Unfortunately this is not possible. All of this might be fine in the US or Western Europe, but in Mexico and Central America if a road doesn't have a number (and is nominally a highway) it probably isn't paved. So avoiding anything with a number is basically going to be sending you along a lot of dirt roads. The app is also then also avoiding lots of rural highways, totally quiet, beautiful, no traffic, two lane roads.   Finally, they made a big deal with an update that made the app display an elevation profile for cycle routes too. This is a big deal for cyclists, as it's important to know the hills you have in front of you (or at least on the one route the app wants you to take). Sadly, this elevation profile is effectively useless too. The profile had nothing on it to show scale, so you have no idea how high the individual peaks are. There is one number given next to an up/down arrow symbol which I think must be net gain??? Or maybe it's total gain??  I really have no idea. And honestly, if you're going to give me one number, give me the highest altitude I'll reach on that route. From there I can guestimate the other climbs.  Maybe the app is ideal for driving. Maybe it works better for cyclists in cities. I don't know. I do know that it's pretty useless for me, except in the rare circumstances that the app and I are in agreement about which road to take.",,
16,"Voice guidance is awful: says keep right/left where I have to go straight, doesn't say exit numbers, doesn't say street names. Search is poor: shows the list, but how do I check these places on the map. I click the place and it shows my current location with the option to route to, but sometimes it shows the destination, go figure! No alternative routes, not optimal route, it can give the route which includes traffic lights, a couple of left turns instead of short residential road and right turn",,
17,"I almost rated this for stars. It's a nice, useful app with some gaps--I really like the basic idea and the maps themselves are accurate and occasionally have nice details (for example, airport gate numbers).  There are some major gaps in searching for foods, shopping, etc., though. Primarily this is just in not having locations. For example, in one city in Japan I did a search for food and it came up with maybe 3 or 4 places when I was aware of dozens close by.  Since it pretty quickly looks for options further away, I was getting results up to fifty miles away (in Japan, traveling fifty miles can take several hours).  It also missed the biggest shopping center in the area.  Still, it's handy for knowing where you are and had the ability to download sections of the world's you're interested in.the interface is also easy to navigate and it came up with Japanese city names easily even though I was using English letters.  Train stations are well-marked and it's pretty easy to follow along with your reason trip to know how much further you need to go and where to get off (note that the routing itself i s by driving rather than public transport, which would have been a nice feature, but that you can simply see where the tracks are).",,
18,"Too many ads. Even more than Google Maps. At least most of the features work in a general sense; just not in my area.  EDIT: I understand that advertising is a resource that allows for development to continue, but you must understand the current default implementation makes any features very unappealing and the entire experience unenjoyable. I uninstalled imediately after the second push ad. Push ads are unacceptable in any form.  I am aware you can opt out of most advertising by going to settings and switching off ""Show offers"", but there's no garuntee your app will stop giving other unwanted push notifications, such as the one asking if the user is aware of the bookmarking feature. DO NOT engage the user outside of the app unless it is for a currently requested function or feature they are actively using, such as continuing navigation while in the background. There are better ways to let users know of features. For example, highlight the area you want to be noticed and give a brief message when the app is launched. This is more benificial for you as well, because a user is more likely to follow through when they have already chosen to engage with the app, as opposed to you trying to pull them away from whatever else they may be doing.",,
19,"Inferior in every possible way to using the online editor. This app doesn't allow you to link to your own earlier posts, crashes often, can sometimes delet your whole draft even unsave a previously update and saved page, and has issues previewing images. It also cannot pull the most recent version of you updates which you created with the web editor. Woe be unto you if you mak long pots, because after a certain size copy/paste stop working and the editor gets so slow you have to wait for the displayed text to catch up to you. What it does do well is present your stats page, manage the site permissions and let you get a rough draft started. Though it has so many problems I'm just using the MS Office apps for my rough drafts and then copy/pasting into the web interface. I'll probably uninstall this soon because it is basically horrible.",,
20,"Decent app. Tried out a few offline nav apps that use osm for data and this had the best looking map display for me. Clean and clear display during navigation a plus. Suggested nav routes were generally good, but did not care for the inability to ignore toll roads as well as to get more than one suggested route. The biggest shortcoming for me was that with just about all osm apps, the POI/address search are useless unless those items are entered in the osm database. A suggestion would be to have a online search function (like MapFactor's google search) to be able to find those items and be able to translate the info into an offline nav point. Another suggestion would be to improve the display functions during navigation, ie: speedometer/speeding warnings, lane assist, and fixed speed cameras. Needs improvements but a solid app overall.",,
21,"This app has gone downhill. Now that Google maps supports offline maps there is absolutely no reason to use this app. It still causes my device to restart. No other app makes my phone restart, only this one. It uses a dodgy background process that makes my phone restart even after I finish using app. They need to add a ""exit"" button to properly close the app. It keeps running services in background even when I force quit the app via task manager. It crams a lot of junk and annoyances in the app. I don't want business names or the ability to rate or share or whatever other junk they force in there. Let me turn all the junk off so I can use the map like a map. Stop asking me to turn on location settings.

OSM doesn't really  support proper Address searching so relying solely on this isn't possible.  I have to go back to Google to find actual full addresses. What I would  like to see changed is; - when searching the results show the downloaded  Map Name which can be confusing as it doesn't match the location of the  address. (please remove this) - would be nice to have other map  overlays/textures to choose from.

They take no responsibility for routes not working because they are using some other company's maps. Removed.",,
24,"Good for reading, a pain for editing. It's a great app for reading and browsing the encyclopedia. The main problem I have with it on that front is that the way it displays lead images in article headers often cuts off important parts of the image; see for example Hammerton Killick- it cuts off his head!   Editing is more problematic - talk pages are impossible to get to, as is article history. Talk and history can be beneficial for readers as well as they give valuable info about reliability and sources of content.",,
25,"Unintuitive I was using this app to walk around Munich, but it was often difficult-to-impossible to see the name of the street I was on. I wanted to use it offline and without using my location (to save battery), but the app constantly prompted me to switch on location. There's a bug in the bookmark view, it's difficult to edit the bookmark for items with a lot of details, it will snap to the bottom or top, and the ""edit"" button is in the middle. Also, navigating the app in general is unintuitive.",,
26,"I wanted to like this app. I'm looking for an alternative to google maps. The routing is actually ok, although the estimated timings don't take traffic conditions into account. The offline operation is good, but there isn't really an 'online' mode. If I currently have a good connection I want to be able to search a new area without having to download the section first. But what has killed it for me is that the search is useless. There us no UK postcode search, which is what I primarily use. Searching by street name sometimes works, but often comes up empty. Conversely when there are multiple matches adding extra location details (borough, etc) doesn't narrow the search effectively. As far as i can tell it treats each term entered separately and at some point if you haven't chosen one of the matches for your first term and keep typing it switches to searching on the second term, ignoring the first. I only managed to experience the navigation by finding places on Google maps, and then matching the street pattern and zooming to find them manually in this. I gather it works better in some countries than others, so I'll probably try it again sometime, but for now I'm giving up.",,
27,Horizontal scrolling ruins this app. Wikipedia is an incredible website but reading articles on a phone with this app is just frustrating. For articles with paragraphs embedded in tables you have to scroll left and right for every line of text just to read it (a great example of this is any list of episodes article for a TV show). Why bother making a mobile app if it's not mobile friendly? If you won't fix this at least add a button to open such articles in a web browser.,,

You have to stop the app restart it with GPS already enabled and it seems to work for the most part but it was very spotty and it makes it extremely hard to use if you don't have time to stop and park and occasionally I had to hit the lower left button to make it connect again if it stopped working.

There is a widget for Habits and Dailies, but not for ToDos, and I this ToDos is the list people would best like to see made into a widget. There is no clean way to take back a button press (If you accidentaly pressed on + and didn't mean to your options are leave it as is even though you didn't earn the rewards or edit the task to include a minus option and take the HP hit). Would be nice if you could automatically sort by Due Date ascending. Creating a Daily and setting it to all days, then editing it and removing the current day still leaves the Daily Active (Same with the reverse if it was first created as not enabled for this day of the week, then editing and enabling it, it remains disabled).

I have around 30,000 images in various picture folders (I am travelling and have a 128GB sd card in my tablet where my images are stored)  and this update to 3.9 has made choosing images impossible.  I have two possible workarounds. Either I upload the images to google or similar and put a link in the post to them. Or my second option is to upload the images in the WordPress app through the media menu item and then choose these images I want in the post using your new chooser interface.  Honestly I see what you are trying to do with the new interface but it does limit the user as to how they choose their images. Handing this task over to the operating system, as it was before, makes more sense and makes your app lighter.  Please switch back to the normal way of adding images.

Some streets are massive! this isn't useful.

The entire party structure and invitation setup is needlessly complicated and frustrating.  The actual task/to do list setup is great.

40,"Disappointing The big plus is the offline use of maps and the maps that look good. On the downside: we disagree on the fastest route. On first use it misses a connection to a highway and suggesting a longer route. Then the app even tries to send me back three times unnecessary, making the journey even longer. Vocal directions are ambiguous compared to my regular Garmin nav and compared to Google. Maybe it's just the dutch language. At times the GPS update seems out of sync with the actual location. Good as a backup nav.",,
41,"The backcountry road maps are pretty accurate for wheelie in the bush couldn't get it to actually work for directions in town or route plan with it. Just getting it again on my new phone.   I did manage to get routes to load. However the search option doesn't find nearby places (addresses) and nearby parks,towns etc easily.  Also I can not seem to alter the route.  For example I put in directions to Sloquet hot springs. The route the app selected is a very rough road compared to the parralel road that also gets you there. It would be nice to select other roads with the touch of a finger. Please improve and get back to me. Thanks for the prompt response on my last review",,
42,FUBAR !! Tried downloading the complete set of maps (about 25 GB) and it screwed up at around 4.5 GB. Would not download any maps at all. My connection was fine BTW.  Am going back to the app at F-Droid. Probably won't have the routing feature or the most recent updates but at least it works. Beware: If you have the F-DROID app and uninstall it all your maps get erased. I lost 25 GB of tediously downloaded maps when I decided to go with the Google Play version. FWIW...... reinstalled the Google Play app.......Still NO GO !!,,
43,"Some App Exclusive Features are Annoying For the most part, the app is fine. However, many of the apps exclusive features get in the way more than they help. The tabs for browsing are really annoying and, IMO, things should only open in new tabs when you long press and choose ""open in new tab"". A gesture to show your tabs would be nice too. The button and panel to jump between categories won't appear/activate far too often. In fact, that's my main reason to use the app over the web interface, so if that doesn't work, the app is basically useless.",,
44,"A significant backward step Now there is no way to select which maps to update, nor is there any indication of download size (why not?). The option to download WITHOUT routing has disappeared. I do not require routing as I already have a sat nav. Fortunately I have not updated my phone, only my tablet. I will not be updating my phone to v6 as this is the device I use most. Until now this was a 5 star app (and I had the paid version before it became free). Hugely disappointed. ------------------UPDATE.

The app also seems to only give you one route  choice, no option to change to quickest or shortest in the settings, or  avoid motorways etc. Can't really comment on much else as I gave up after  learning those things. All in all it's basic, the navigation is competent  but very sensitive to kinks in a road (so be prepared to bear left / right  a lot when you're just following a road).

However the real problem is that I am unable to create anything but short routes due to the limitations in the amount of stops that I can add; given there are tons of forest roads you can never pick the one you like and make something longer than 30km of a route; It also isn't even a paid feature, I'd have paid for such feature in a heartbeat.  Two fixes, having 3 stops is ok if I can chain routes, as in save them and load them quickly; or allowing to add up to 10+ stops, the average that you need on 80+km rides on these forest mazes.  Back to square one having to buy a GPS, and these garmins aren't cheap at all; I am however pleased on how close this was to actually work, that I dared to write this review; hoping they implement it, even if it's paid; maybe they can have competition in something they never expected to.",,

It will put you off major highways in favor of small local ""colorful"" side roads. We just spent 3 weeks in a motor home in Great Britain. The first week was hell trying to drive a wide motor home on narrow single lane back roads with oncoming traffic. I did miss the truck but took out the left side mirror on an overhanging sign instead ($457). Often it favored local side roads literally side by side and paralleling expressways.  ______ Update: Maps.me responded asking for my original specific coordinates. I suggested they pick any spot 50 miles outside London and a 2nd spot 50 miles on the opposite side.

It should search only in the city you are at. If it had google's map search engine like, this would be definitely the best offline app for maps.  And it is not possible to add a city name with the street you are searching. As soon as you start typing more letters all the results disappear and a weeping dog appear saying ""no results"".

Streets that I don't need to use for my way are hardly visible during navigation which makes harder to compare map to actual turns on my way and consequently makes harder to define whether actual turn I approach is the one map talks about or it's the next one.

All of this use to be instant. For an offline map the only thing they seem to be updating is online features like traffic and stuff. Its basically becoming useless.

In each case, when the app is restarted, it will have reverted to a state prior to the current session. Since, while exploring a new subject, it crashes as often as twice per minute, it has effectively become nigh unusable.

While the program correctly identified my being at my home, and while it correctly identified the name of the street I was on, when I tried to search for my full address, including the house number, it could not find the address and suggested similarly named streets in other towns. When I asked for the Walgreen pharmacy, it identified such pharmacies in distances of over 4 miles, but failed to identify the pharmacy that is less than half a mile from where I was. When I asked for restaurants, it failed to identify the 99 Restaurant two blocks away from my home, while identifying another restaurants offer the same chain, several miles away.  In my opinion, the application completely failed the test. If I were in an unfamiliar city, (which is the point of a mapping application), I need to find the nearest gas station, ATM, pharmacy, or a specific address. If I cannot rely on Maps with Me to do that, I have no use for it. I have requested cancellation of my purchase.",,

102,"Clunky I have no idea how this has a 4.6 star rating. There's no importing of favorite places. Very unintuitive to set your favorites like home and work. Not user friendly to navigate to your favorites. The voice is very unnatural sounding. Turn directions do not include street name that you're turning onto. Distances read out in feet instead of miles (""turn left in 3000 feet"" vs. 1/2 mile). Finally, it's worse than Google maps about unnecessarily telling you to keep left to stay on the interstate at off ramps.",,

First one, I started a post, and I wanted to save it, so I pressed the arrow in the up corner to acces next options, but that icon is a ""paper airplane"" that publish the post without even ask! Alright, first use... I search for something like post adjustments (oh, they were in the footer!), and changed the post to local draft. But it NEVER went to draft again in the blog!. Worst than that, I continued editing it, and the next time I accessed it, a message appeared, something like ""the post is not updated, do you want to?"" and I thought of course, upload the changes, but what it did was download the first draft (the published one) overwriting the last one so I completely lost ALL of my work. ""Well, let's see the revisions..."" but there's NOTHING like that. On top of all that, I searched the internet for help, and the only possible solution needed my device rooted before all this, and search some hidden directories, but it comes to happen that there are lots of people who doesn't even know what is to root an android device. ABSOLUTELY AWFUL!!!",,
104,"Needs a long way to go. Many street names are missing. The font size is way toooo small - just not useable. I want to travel to Thailand but because of the lack of street names and small font size there is no way that i could use it on my Samsung Galaxy Tab2 with 7 inch screen. At the best it gives me a general idea. It displays English as well as the local language which means nothing to me and only serves to clutter the map. In my home country, Australia, many street names are missing so it is of no use at all. In my opinion if you are going to create an app then at least do a good job. Much better to start small and do one country well first before taking on the whole world.   :-)",,

You can download just the areas you need to your internal or external storage and always have access (the KitKat external SD ""sandbox"" is supported).  The map will follow your position if you have location enabled.  One serious flaw is the inability to interpret address info being sent from other applications, so you can't use this application as your default map.  Links from calendar, e-mail, and browser apps will just go to the middle of the ocean near Africa at Lat/Lon 0/0).  Another issue is cross-map routing: you can't plan a route across state or country boundaries that cross map files.",,
108,"Yet to be convinced... This seems to be an interesting app, no doubt, BUT it does not work for me. Why? 1. Font size hopelessly small even for a 5.2-inch smartphone screen. Maybe on a ten-inch tablet... 2. No options for routes (fastest, shortest, easiest..). It seems to automatically opt for shortest routes, which are not always the most convenient. 3.

The most unbearable problem so far is the poor searching function: tried to find a certain address but the map can not actively find the exact location and re-center the map to the target location. Moreover, it seems that the app does not recognize the address at all and do nothing. If you can not even search an address then this maps in a sense is crippled.

113,"Fine for pedestrians, problematic for driving. i've used this to get around by foot several times, with no notable problems except that it continually resets ""north is up"" view every time the screen turns on (which agitates me to no end). While driving, though, its voice volume is too low to hear above ambient background noise (GMaps has an extra voice volume booster for this), it almost invariably waits until a navigation point is directly beside you before telling you about it (""turn left... behind you""), and it often picks a far-out-of-the-way route when a straight line would work just fine. i used this on my last trip by car and it ended up costing me an additional 25%+ driving distance because of voice delays and truly curious navigation choices. The only strong argument in favor of this app over gmaps is its ability to be used  completely offline.",,

Update: I found the problem - it started to download ""Quebec city"" and I stopped it, because Sherbrooke is in Quebec province and the two are not the same. There are other errors, like Montreal city-Quebek, where k should be a c. Good thing this app lets you contribute to open street maps, but all those mistakes I mentioned are not OSM errors.

This lack of app sync is a real frustration, then. (Also, I cannot see any way to change the email address associated with the account on the app.This is also true when signed in on a web browser, so I presume that it's a general Wikipedia problem, but the situation is certainly unsatisfactory.)

123,"Useful, but needs work Hats off to the dev team ... this app is easy to use and does its job. A major problem, though, with the Ireland maps (at least), was that route lines overlaid the street and highway names. So, we could use this app only as an advisory to a physical map, where we could see actual street and highway names. Google Maps solves this problem by putting the route lines over the streets but under the street names. Overall, close but no cigar ... hoping for improvement in the future!",,

I use the app for when I don't want or have time to sit down at my pc to do updates.      Where I thought the app shined was maintaining my WP sites. The app allowed me to be able to easily cycle through all my sites quickly to see if they needed plugin or WP updates. After selecting the admin option, I could click each site and within minutes have all the sites updated, significantly quicker than using a pc to do it.    With the latest update to the app, the developers buried the admin page access 3 clicks deep, so what would take me 1 click + a click per site to check update status, now requires me to click into the settings, then 2 clicks per site to check for update status.    I considered this app a 5 star app before this bizarre change. I'm hoping it was an oversite or test on the developers part and that they'll fix this in the next update.

At one point, the route it chose added about an hour to a six-hour drive. The triangle icon indicating direction of travel often pointed perpendicular or opposite to the actual direction of travel, or ran alongside the road, or across open fields or bodies of water. Amusing on the autobahn, but a real pain when driving slowly or walking in a city center or small village. Gives very short notice for lane changes/exits. And unlike Google Maps which will say ""slight right"" or ""use right lane,"" this app tends to say only ""turn right!"" Which, again, is confusing. If you can use it, Google Maps is way better.

I searched a location on the other side of  the city. The app only offered me one option for a route and, as a local,  it's not one that I would ever take - neither fastest nor shortest  distance. I started out on the route anyway and then purposefully deviated,  waiting to see how it would handle the route change. The answer is not  well. It directed me to turn around for the next several minutes even  though I was headed towards a major freeway, which was closer. If I'm using  this overseas and a road is closed for whatever reason, this app is never  going to help me get around the detour. Im going to have to figure it out  myself. Even after I got on the freeway, navigation continued to try to  route me off at the next several exits, which would have been way out of  the way. I'm super disappointed.

In the avatar creation, I had to keep pressing the options I wanted over and over for it to actually work, then when I finished the avatar had options I didn't pick. Every habit defaults to being both positive and negative. I know there has to be some default, but it's kind of weird that if I have a positive habit I have to tap the negative button. Adding tags is really clunky because the tags have to be added to the filter, (I guess it works but it's unintuitive to have to add a tag to the filter instead of just tagging the task itself) but when I add them they don't immediately get added. They disappear and then get added a few minutes later. Half the time it won't let me move around the tasks. Sometimes the FAQ text pops up overlaying whatever screen I'm on. Switching between habits, dailies, to-dos, and rewards is finicky. Sometimes swiping doesn't work, sometimes trading the icon doesn't work. I have to tap things in the equipment menu multiple times for them to work. Same for the avatar menu.

153,"One of the most problematic and difficult apps on my device.... This is even more unfortunate, since millions of users out there trust and use worpress - while this weak app is the only real smartpgone tool available to access your site. After logging in relatively quick and smoothly, things start by looking promising. But as soon as you start to try publishing or sharing media, the app starts bombarding error messages.

I attempted an uninstall/reinstall and the same problem occurs. The window also begins cutting off longer posts. The post is still there, but you will need to use your up/down buttons instead of the scroll function to see it. There is also no menu once you get to the post screen. Navigation between dashboard, post, and post options is difficult. I have been frustrated by the last several updates to this app. If you need to only post text, it isn't so bad, hence two stars. Any posts beyond simple, short text should be done online.",,
155,"Wow, what has happened to this app. It used to be so good and extremely user-friendly.  Even after downloading a number of maps it still can't find it's arse with it's own hand. Not impressed with the new version. I have increased my opinion by one star because the Maps Me guys responded to my problems and really made an effort to sort out my issues. I feel there are still issues to be fixed so will see if this can again be a 5 star app. One issue is if you select a landmark without a direct road access then try to get a routing it doesn't work.  You have to select a road outside the landmark, what?? Secondly when doing search for somewhere like Xi'an China if you forget the apostrophe Xian City  itself does not appear, just 300 hotels etc in Xian that spell it without the apostrophe. Minor bug but still a pain if you don't know the exact spelling. Will still use it, but before I never considered using anything else,  now will keep my eye out for something better. Doubt it but you never know.",,

163,Introduces one to a world of interesting people. I like the app but wonder sometimes why WordPress suggests that I share posts on social media to increase views when I have done so to several sites the day before and had multiple comments and likes on those sites but WP shows me having less than one-third as many views or worse. People follow my blog or like a specific post but somehow there are no views that day. The notifications are useful but sometimes seem inaccurate.,,
164,I like the app and it works well for me to set things up . I have published an about me section and a blog post. It shows up on my end but when I try to view it externally it just says that a new wordpress site is coming. I just wish that when it's published on my end that it also publishes online. Now I have to figure out how to get my blog online so others can view it too.,,

It allows me to copy one sentence or one example or one item on the long list of information regarding that word, but it does not allow me to copy the word with its complete definitions.

However it is borderline useless when navigating great distances. It only offers one route and it is always the most direct route. That means if the most direct route is through the center of a massive city as supposed to using a ring road. It's taking you through the city. This has happened to me a few times while using maps.me and since I don't know the area it's bitten me in the ass almost everytime. Something that would take 30min using the ring roads instead takes 2hrs because you have to go through the whole city. It also has a very hard time rerouting. Several times I followed the road signs instead of the app and it refused to reroute, it didn't even reroute a turn around. It just kept spinning the map in circles.

In many cases the offline cache of Google Maps is good enough (Japan) and in other areas Google Maps data can actually be downloaded explicitly for a defined region. There is massive room for improvement here.  [Adressing the response to the review: It is not that features are ""bad"". It is the lack of features which I am a bit unhappy about. Combine the (OSM data-driven) features of ""Locus Map"", ""GPS Navigation & Maps"" and ""MapFactor: GPS Navigation"" with the existing feature set and get a very nice app. Aggregate *more* data, make the OSM data more accessible, see for instance the email conversation we had three months ago.

Kudus! 2 .- I have received few times failures in planning a walk, and was advised to define a different start or end point.  I fail to understand both. 3. There is a very unstable behavior you need to solve. When walking along a planned path, even a very straight one, the view keep rotating clockwise and back. This is annoying behavior. 4. When walking along a plan path, the software does not take care to move the visible map window, therefore I have to take care of this. 5. It should be possible to decide which data layer is drawn. For example, when I look for a monument and the search can not find it and I want to finger choose it, I don't want to see icons of restaurants. 6. There should be integrated icon explanation. 7.

215,"UPDATE: I'd expected this robo response, because it's the only one given in this reviews section... ""call us"".  No offense but that's the *laziest* way to handle common recurring tech issues... you (the user) do something.    Here's a tip:  put in your software an error tracking feature that uploads ""cannot post"" and ""generic"" errors and other similar ""cannot do that.. failed"" errors to you and YOU FIGURE IT OUT.  I can tell this software is not robustly developed and tested.  Another alternative would be for you to give meaningful diagnostic answers so we can all benefit from solutions found and discussed here.  Terrible support model going on here.   Original review:  Absolutely WORTHLESS and UNRELIABLE.  This WP app feels like an Alpha version that hasn't been tested.  Does NOT handle SHARING well if at all.  Too many bugs and failures to list.  Using Galaxy Note 8 w latest Androidd. Sad.  This is late May 2019.",,

Then I can't save the username and display name I create, and the avatar generator screen doesn't load any options. Opened the app the next day to find nothing I could edit had been saved. Uninstalled and tried registering again with a different account and got the same results. Pretty disappointed",,

However, I realized the map is mostly in Japanese (unlike Google Map). The hotels that I've booked cannot be found using the search function. I supposed you would need to enter the hotel name in Japanese in order for the search to work. Google map works wonder using English. I wonder if I can get a refund. Even without using the search function, the Osaka map is difficult to read (compared to Google Map) as it is mostly in Japanese.",,
220,"Hated it! This used to be a really nice app until I got the latest update. It's slow, loads very few posts on the reader and when it hangs while I'm using it, other people can't access my site! I simply hate and I advice you not to update your app if your still using the old version.  . . Oh, and another thing, you can't view all your followers and the stats area is just complicated and useless. They have also removed the widgets area",,

It does this often when I am on the train, so it forces me to do extra step of saving page, just in case my connection might go off while I am reading article.

224,"Used to be a nice app but it seems it is getting worse as time passes. The  latest is that is impossible to sync/transfer your bookmarks. The help is  outdated giving you wrong indications, making you loose a lot of time. They  say that your bookmarks are in a folder on SD card. No folder and no  bookmarks there. They say you should sign in to backup your bookmarks in a  safe place, but you can tap all day long on the sign in button, nothing  happens... But they also say that if you by miracle manage to sign in,  those bookmarks will not be available on other devices. May be they all  have the same phone from 6-7 years ago and never had to transfer their  bookmarks... They say you can share bookmarks with your friends. I've  shared one of my many lists via Wi-Fi direct between my devices, but it's  archived and there is no option to import. Now you have to download another  app to extract that archive but still no way to import them... Awful waste  of time...",,

Please make them more obvious and easier to switch between them.The last thing is about the buttons at the top,when you have an article with an image with white background is kinda hard to see all those buttons at the top.",,
226,"Poor hog This navigator is very poor in customisation options (no next turn icon/distance, no direction indicator, no speed limit warning, no speedcam warning/distance etc.) It also hogs on resources, downloading base maps as .obb files, which cannot be moved to the SDcard, taking about 50MB of internal memory. Finally, downloading maps on a PC to transfer them into Maps.ME directory didn't work, it couldn't find them, re-downloading them and making me waste time (at least, those maps were on the SDcard).",,

Download maps for 2 countries that have mutual borders. turn off internet. select location in one country and click 'roure to' select another point in second country , and then app tells you that system error has occured. about a year ago it was saying that you need to download map in same conditions after a year it throws system error (no details in the message, consider giving more descriptive messages to user) , thats opposite to progress",,
228,"The app is pretty handcuffed when compared with the web editor. The app lacks easy linking to already published posts, a way to copy a previous post, and the mouse support on Android is terrible - formatting buttons and most dialog boxes don't respond to mouse clicks at all. Basic interaction with the admin side, such as comment moderation and stats are fine, but for actually creating and publishing content, the app is very much a second class citizen compared to the web editor. Full integration of the web editor capabilities would make for a much better experience.",,
229,"Great app based on features, AWFUL due to bugs! Still using it daily, after restarting it several times, but the bugs are a huge drawback!  Will change the review once I will be able to rearrange the tasks without having them moved back were they  were (or placed somewhere in-between), when it wouldn't crash when I set a notification on a task, when the party tabs don't appear on tasks view, and when the animals appear in the app when they are found, not hours later (refresh + app restart = no use in this case).",,

I used settings to download the maps to my external SD card. The app shows and says that maps or downloading/downloaded at first. If I exit the app and reenter. only a couple of maps now show as downloaded. Tried to uninstall/install several times and still does not work correctly.

Let's get this working together!,,

Not for me, I enjoy simplicity.",,
232,"Updated Version SUCKS. Basically ruined a good app by adding a bunch of annoying, extra features -_- The original version was fine. The updated version loads extremely slow & takes forever to find what I want in the suggestions. I type in one thing to get one result & a bunch of stuff come up that I don't want. I just want what I'm looking for to come up , not all of that extra stuff. Also, what's the point of adding those tabs, that U have to click on to open every different section? If U click a link & go to another page & go back to the prev page, U can't see it becuz the tab closed.",,
233,"Slow Routing I used this in August 2016 to drive from the UK to Mongolia and it was a fantastic, simple and responsive app. Updates since have made for a slicker interface to the detriment of routing speed. It now takes a minute to map a route across France and a similar time to reroute.",,

It's so buggy and I can't get any help on any of the bugs I experience. Like the fact that I don't do any damage when my cron rolls over. Yea�?I get no response from the developers.  The only reason I use this app is for the sake of quests? Because everything else is so boring. But even the quests are dull. And if you're in a big party, they don't even scale it properly? There's nothing like having a quest start and then having it finish a couple hours later before you even have a chance to do anything. Not to mention it totally lacks the ability remind you of anything. All it does is nag you everyday at a set time. That's all it's capable of. Set a to do with a due date? Great but you won't get a reminder about it. Not to mention the fact that it still doesn't allow any form of offline capabilities. And they just make up excuses for why they can't have it. Which I don't buy because I've used other apps like this where I can go offline and use it. Its slow as hell.  And for forcing me to be connected to the internet it doesn't even notify me of new posts from my guilds and party.",,
236,Good but missing Custom Post Type support. I add CPTs into most of my sites and only being able to update blog entries is very limiting. Image handling is a bit buggy. Really good when fixing typos or creating quick posts. The earlier versions of this app were way more functional.,,
237,"Probably the best offline map application I removed 2 stars for all this spam I get in my notification bar after last update! I need offline map. That's it.

240,Garbage!! Cannot input house numbers This trash gps app does not allow you to search by house/building numbers only by  street names. If you try to search the number with the street name you WILL NOT get results.,,
241,"Hard to believe this is the official app I just used this to perform a relatively simple task - edit a post and upload some images. The post editor showed all the markup for links, formatting etc, which looks messy and is hard to navigate. Worse still, I wanted to upload more than one image, which I wasn't given the option of. I had to upload each one separately and re-find the folder they were stored in each time, which is time consuming and tedious. The mobile website is flawed, but much better than this so I'll go back to that.",,
242,"Still better to use a web browser Pros: Useful to quickly view a single article but that's it.   Cons: Text does not re-flow to fit screen when zoomed, No text selection. Tables do not resize to fit screen and columns off screen are lost. No way to open links separately for later reading i.e. in new tab or window. This means current article and reading position are lost when a link is selected.  Please add tabbed browsing so links can be opened in separate tabs, and reflow text.

243,"First, you should be able to enable all POIs along your route. It would be really helpful to see gas stations or restaurants without having to search for them. MapPoint has this feature and it works well. Second, is night mode. It saves power and is easier on the eyes. Third, is a navigation view instead of the typical overhead view. And forth is voice guided navigation. The map files seem to be large too (compared to other offline mapping apps), any way you can make them smaller?",,
244,"It's all around good, but the route calculating algorithm is not good. It tends to choose the longer route than other GPS apps and the only way to chose an alternative route is to manually add stops. Searching is also a hassle as the results are usually street names that use any single word you type from closest to farthest. (For example, typing ""Sebago Lake State Park"" brings up all the ""State Route""s.) Not good when you wanna trek out to another state.",,
245,"[EDIT:] Thanks for your reply. Even without GPS, this would still be very useful as a detailed, zoomable map if it could be reliably used offline, as your description implies.

How about relaxing a bit about that, and letting us update when we can?",,
246,"anyone else notice that the formatting is all screwed up since the new update? the bottom of the wiki pages the last bit of the page overlaps with the ""about this article"" section. Extremely annoying. and they still only have the history button available from the main page. Why do I have to go all the way to the main page to hit the button and see my page history? That's just incredibly inefficient.",,
247,Excruciatingly annoying Impossible to search without app insisting on downloading more maps. Deleting. Even after downloading a bunch of maps the app doesn't allow route planning. Just the boring freeways. Might as well use Waze or Google Maps. The search goes on.,,
248,"This is very detailed map, great job for that, I give you that. But there are some things that's annoys me, like: 1. You start release map updates together with app updates, so you can't update just maps. (OK you told me I can go to your website and download just maps and put it in folder. Not big problem, but stil...) 2. Expected arrival time, now is way off then before. In much older versions, like 6.5.4., EAT was much better. And yes, I already contacted about that with examples, and you still didn't fix that. 3. I would love to see options like: avoid highways and to have options for alternative routes. Yes, you add, add stop option, but this things would be much better. Hope you will consider all this things.",,

250,Lacking options When adding an image to a post I cant set alt text or remove the link off the pic... this app is pathetic. It has so much potential yet too little effort has been made :( can't even view the html editor to remove the link and change alt text.

Now it's like the Chinese Google though not as good.",,
256,"I wish this was better, then I could delete Google. This doesn't show alternative routes. The search isn't great either, it often doesn't show places that come up straight away on the devil's Google Maps - I can often find roads, but when I type in a number on the road it doesn't show it. :(",,
257,"Searching for a street referenced with the suburb of a city results in a ""not found"". Alternatively searching for the same street referenced with the city instead, brings up all the streets in all the suburbs with that name including the street that you are looking for, but the difficulty then is working out which street is the one you bu to the city.

Where did it go and how do I get it back? If this is not fixed I am uninstalling the app as it is totally useless to me without the full version of the editor. As well, the web based editor crashes EVERY SINGLE TIME I do an update to a blog.

Sometimes an update would relocate your maps to the phone, sometimes it would delete all maps, sometimes you had to uninstall and reinstall, sometimes ....  This time they have surpassed it : it moved all my SD CARD maps to memory, filling it right up!! And today there is no option to locate maps to SD CARD any more.  2 years and they still can't get this simple but ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL feature to hold.

Even before doing anything with it, and without running it, it's CONSTANTLY trying to contact Facebook & Google & who knows what else. They blame it on the SDK, but a) it shouldn't be doing it when I haven't even launched the app in forever, and b) other apps aren't nearly as bad. Pretty much every other app shows a handful of attempts, this one goes on for pages. & huge app size for what it is.",,
285,Uploading media does not work properly. Some files do not upload and the app does not resume automatically which is annoying. But even worse: Some files are uploaded several times if you try to re-upload and then you end up with duplicates. Also if the app closes in the background it starts uploading all media of a post again. There is also no source editing. Recently it just started crashing in the media library. In summary the media upload is useless.,,
286,Desperately needs an overhauling This used to be a four star app but has become into something that instantly reminds you of the good ol Gingerbread days. Please switch to Androids modern menu layout that's being used by so many decent apps. Why is there still menu key in the bottom bar? Move it to the side and make it swipeable. Also horizontal scrolling is a mess. As in nonexisting. 90 percent of all articles could easily be scraped since there's no way to read them properly. The website is so much better.,,
287,"I really like having access to OSM and this app works well for that. However search is slow and inaccurate .. But the most frustrating thing is map update.

Now this app has ads and to get rid of them you have to pay a monthly subscription. They changed the rules in the middle of the game, I'm deleting it from all my devices. This app works offline after you download maps. Searching for an address is not good. You can import KMZ files, such as places you've mark in Goolge Maps.",,
291,This used to be a good app. Now it refuses to update the routes in certain parts of the uk and now is impossible to use to get to anywhere but the 4 places in the country that can be updated. I used this for work and now its totally useless. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling but its exactly the same. If this isn't fixed I'll be deleting the app permanently. At this moment in time I would not recommend this app to even my worst enemy (yes it really is that bad!!),,
292,"While travelling in UK and Ireland we ran into a number of occasions where  voice directions were opposite to the visual ques. The visuals being  corrected on all occasions.

So, back to hunting for a to-do app. Edit 3/23: I have to drop my review on this to 1 star. You can manually edit values within the app for stats making any it unreasonable that I need internet.",,
294,"Good app but why can't I select my starting point, It always take the the starting point as the current location. There should be an option to select my starting location of my choice.

Well, the old-school 8-bit graphics - not everyone likes it.",,

All of the location settings was on,as always,but for some reason, this app couldn't work. I found wifi nearby,downloaded other app that had offline Rome maps,and used that one.

The only issues I'm having are that I have yet to be able to upload a picture. I think this feature is worth one whole star. I tried uploading a picture on my provider network and over WiFi, neither worked. The other issue I'm having is that I can't seem to check categories for my post. I have to log in through my browser to do that. It may be user error but I couldn't find that option. All in all, it works for generic text posts - at least for me. I'll take that over NOTHING!",,

305,"Awful. it'll never give you the information you need. Stick with Google Maps. You can Download maps offline on Google too. I tried finding the public transport options from one city to the next (takes about one hour) but your app said ""This route is too far for pedestrians to walk"", 1, i wasn't asking for walking directions and 2, who are you to say what's too far. People have walked around the earth.",,

There's a particular layout I prefer and despite whatever tweaking I do, when the post is published, things aren't aesthetically how I want them to be. Earlier I had the freedom to just type stuff out and add images and publish it. Of course less options existed for formatting&alignment. The app is still quite user-friendly though.",,

Then when you go back into the app to see what is going on it deletes the post you were trying to upload and you are left with only the title and the knowledge that you have entirely wasted your time and need to write the whole thing and locate all the media files again. Totally frustrating. It worked fine on iOS.",,
310,"There should be a way to manage saved posts (sort them, put into collections, etc.). Moreover, the number of saved posts shouldn't be limited. Actually the old ones don't get unsaved (when I view them on browser, then choose ""View in Reader"", the posts are still marked as ""Saved"") but they are not displayed in Saved posts so I can't access them offline (which is the reason I use the save function). And when visiting someone's blog, I prefer seeing an outline of their posts, which can help me access ANY post of that person, over an incomplete list of posts sorted chronically which doesn't display all of their posts (some of them are only accessible on the app through browser, so what's the point of using the app over browser?)",,
311,Terrible. Keeps coming up with couldnt sink doesnt show me any of my blogs. cant go on setting cant post nothing the only thing that works is view my site. It worked the first day i downloaded the app then i did some work to my site put some posts on etc and after that the app just went terribly wrong. whoever runs this app seriously need to fix it coz its just a joke. if i want to blog when im out and dont have a laptop with me i cant coz this app dont work.

And when I go online to refresh them it can't do that either.  Just displays a blank page without doing anything with the busy bar constantly recycling.  Very poor.  Hopefully you will issue an urgent fix for this.,,
320,love the app but there is something that bugs me for quite a while. if i am in dark mode (or any other mode execpt the standard light one) all bars or little squares (i.e. bars that display the number of seats of a party in a parliament or those little squares that are used to differentiate parties by color) are completely blank. looks like an easy fix. hopefully you understand what i mean. thanks edit: haven't tried it yet. i fear that my viewing history gets lost(i think it doesnt get synced),,

323,"Read the significant issues before installing (you only get one chance) This app has promise however it's not without some serious issues.  First, page compositing (especially tables and large images) is exceedingly poor compared to the same page in-browser. You can't even scroll sideways in order to see the entire sidebar.  Second, The complete takeover of the web browser while running is unacceptable. It makes taking a side detour in your search impossible and if you go too deep into links, you have to back ALL the way out of them in order for the app to close itself and return your browser. The only way around this is to kill the process.  Third, the inability to remove the link association in Chrome and Chrome Beta is extremely poor design on the part of the programming team which I would like to see resolved. Basically this makes following links in a google search impossible after the app is uninstalled.",,
324,"It was clean, without unnecessary informatoon I rated it with 5 stars before but now I am considering to delete it although I invested in maps.

Not even important landmarks in cities are noted. Very poor busines ethics.",,
325,"Update made it less useful Version 2.6.1 seems to have fixed the upload error issue. Thanks for the quick response!  I'm still unimpressed with the changes to the interface but I can live with that.  Original review: SGS III with Android 4.3. Uploading a post from my phone since the update results in an error notification 80% of the time. And yes I am logged in to my Wordpress account,  Also, the new interface requires more steps just to send a simple post as the post settings have been moved to a separate page for no apparent reason.",,
326,"Great for posting on the go.... but not much else. If you have jetpack, you can look at site stats. You can also review and approve comments.The limited functionality is why I didn't give it 5 stars. I understand XMLRPC can only do so much.  One feature that I want to see is uploading images from the phone directly to the Media Library for use later. There would be an entry added to the android ""Share"" context menu as well for that.",,
327,"I really, really wanted to like this. The concept is genius, but the execution needs a little tweaking. I had a difficult time using the app, because the tutorials were very basic and didn't cover most of what to do. It seemed like if you didn't buy gems, then you couldn't go on quests. I appreciate that the developers need and deserved to be paid for their hard work, but not being able to use most of the rpg elements, negated the motivation to stay productive and use the app. I like the idea of accountability among friends, but the invite system is unusable. It's a QR code and aside from having no idea what to do with it, every time I clicked on it, it downloaded somewhere I couldn't find it on my S8. With a few changes, this could be an amazing app, but it feels like many of the gameplay elements were added as an afterthought to a regular organization app instead of making being productive in real life feel like a game. I love the health system and the seperation of habits and dailies. I also love that you're health decreases when you don't complete a daily task. If the party and questing system were improved, my productivity and appreciation for this app would soar. Please don't stop improving and developing this app. It could be a trendsetter for a whole new genre of games.",,

Did a test drive today on a route I know well. 1st mistake was telling me to take the second exit in the roundabout when that leads to the airport, all the exits are named streets and it should have been the third exit. Keeps telling me to keep left, keep right on a windy road with no exits. Tells me three streets and a half mile before the only possible turn for my destination to take a right. Tells me at an intersection to go left and without moving the car it states go right which was the correct way to go. Three major mistakes on a five mile trip is unacceptable. For reference tried out a different app on the return and it was 100% correct.",,
338,"I like the app, but I've got a few suggestions.  1)Adding an option to see your activity history and the ability to edit it.  2)Stats showing your habits/dailies progress, when you did or didn't do things.  3)Improving widget; adding one for habits and reducing the size of the entries.  4)If a daily has multiple subtasks, allowing to mark it as ""partially completed""",,
339,"Cycling directions are really annoying. The app will chose ANY alternative  to using a highway, even if it means turning a 50km route into a circuitous  150km route crossing borders and backtracking. Great example for cycle  tourers in Central Asia: routing from Dushanbe to Khorogh. Maps routes you  through Afghanistan to avoid a legal and quiet highway. Even using  waypoints results in backtracking and crossing into Afghanistan. If maps  won't take the time to figure where it is legal to use highways, they  should at least make using highways an option. Long distance cyclists need  to use them, and having an elevation profile is very useful for trip  planning. 5 out of 5 if they add an option for cycle directions using  highways (or even provide an elevation profile for driving directions) Also  could use more waypoints.",,

362,"Yes and no I used this app during vacation in LA. I was happy with it cause there's a lot of details on the map. However... 1. The search by address in offline mode didn't work for me, don't know why... 2. It would be great if there are alternative routes to choose from. For example, avoid highway and toll way. 3. Would be great if there is an alarm when you're driving exceeding the speed limit.",,
363,"Lacking Directions Although this app is awesome because of the offline maps, there are no turn-by-turn directions. It has navigation, but you don't know the street name of where you're turning so it isn't that great. Especially on a highway or interstate. If that was fixed, this would be the best app. As of now, can't replace Google Maps.",,
364,"Need to be more detailed! Seems great at 1st,  but when you really need to search for exact location especially in foreign land(In my case Melbourne),  I find most address and street name unavailable. This is like a very draft beta version of Google map.",,
365,"Don't understand good ratings The program looks nice but you can't even enter an address or load a contact. No address I have tried was recognized, only POIs. Using marshmallow on brand new phone. These addresses can be found in OSM. Finds street but ignores house numbers every time. Searching multiple addresses in and around Boston MA and Albany NY. For example search for POI Homewood Suites Boston and you get 35 Middlesex Turpike Billerica MA which is correct; but try to search MA Billerica ... 35 and  you get a building 35 nearby.",,
366,"Useless to me without tabs I wish I could like this app, but the lack of tabbed browsing is a dealbreaker for me. When I read Wikipedia articles, I like to open up any interesting-looking links in a new tab, so that I can read those pages once I'm done reading whatever article I'm on. Having to leave the article I'm reading in order to check out another article is a huge problem for me in terms of usability. It's a shame, because otherwise this app is much better than using the mobile site.",,
367,"i was liking for a place outside of my area, i searched for it but the app couldn't figure it out past my location. i don't leave bad reviews ever! but this app sucks. so does Google maps because they don't know what an update is. if you want to see if a location has changed find someone with an iphone. it's the only thing they're good for.",,
368,"Why change what works So I updated the app yesterday and wish I hadn't. Was happy with the layout showing stats and view site together but now it has moved view site to bottom of screen and has a tab called Plan, which looks like a tool to sell your add ons.",,
369,I really enjoy this app up until about an hour ago. all of a sudden during a quest my party disappeared and my friends messaged me to ask what happened. I have also tried to join a help guild to ask but the app wont let me join a guild or post in chat at all now. please fix this bug so me and my friends can enjoy the app.,,
370,"Bloatware. I want a Wikipedia search. Bloated with news, trending, picture of the day. If you hide the card the immediatly come back with other info. No way to disable. Distracts you of your original objective. Hedious.",,
371,"good idea, bad implementation. 1-is slow, resets results of the search after switching to different app (incoming call, sms..) 2-doesnot allow horizontal scrolling when viewing long formulas in articles 3-cant save ""bookmarks"" on found articles.",,
372,"I am very surprised and disappointed that at January 2017, this app still has severe a reoccurring problems with saving & syncing articles to your account permanently. It just doesn't seem to work, I frequently lose my lists. And I've only ever used two Samsung Note devices over the past two years. To at least somewhat alleviate that issue, sync should be activated automatically and login as well as sync status should be visible while surfing (almost) any Wikipedia page / content, not just under Settings.",,
373,"Not well adapted for Android I'm quite satisfied of the blog as a customer, but as an admin the site is awful. When I want to copy some of my text or even write a new page or article, the first screen thumbtouch engaging keypad, it goes to top page? When I want to change for example title menu it refresh for each single letter??? And there are few problems which i'm also not entirely satisfied. Can you fix it please? This app doesn't fit on android phone, moreover since nothing has been fixed, I changed to 1 star",,
374,"Last maps update is a disaster. Can't update a thing, mentions lack of space due to limitations of Android 4.4 (I'm on 5.1 and have a 64GB card set as disk writing destination) and on it's own adds a list of Caribbean islands to the download list.",,
375,"I've been using this app for car and pedestrian navigation for years, but this latest version is simply useless for car navigation. I just got back from a weekend car trip in the Netherlands, using the app for each segment to navigate. About 20 (!) times in 2 days the map display would simply freeze. Sometimes for a minute, or 2, or 5, sometimes it just hung and you had to kill the app and restart it. The voice announcements still worked (as did the speed indicator), but since this app's turn-by-turn instructions are often ambiguous and sometimes just plain wrong, you can't rely on them, so having a frozen map is really the worst thing for navigation. We lost quite a bit of time around Arnhem, Oosterbeek, Nijmegen, etc. having to stop at the side of the road to restart the navigation. And that wasn't just on my phone, we also used the app in parallel on my wife's phone and it hung at *exactly* the same places. So the current version would really get only one star for car navigation.",,
376,"I used to swear by Habitica for a long time, but frankly I find it almost unusable. The biggest, most important problem is the way sync works. You can't use Habitica if offline (or have bad internet connection), you can't click several buttons in quick succession, and you are never sure if clicking a button actually sends data to server, Android widgets are absolutely unusable. Habitica's manual frames it as if it's not their, but user's fault.  I have more than a dozen of Habits and about the same amount of Dailies, most of which are themselves checklists. I keep track of multiple habits, therefore I open Habitica and press + and - many times a day, sometimes several times in an hour. If every time I try to register a Habit or a Daily I must worry about Habitica not syncing properly, then it robs me of time and mental energy. Which makes it useless for actually instilling habits.",,
377,Terrible app This app has many street names missing.Google Maps far more accurate than this I want my money back!,,
378,"Gave it a second try after many months. Old bugs are still there. In addition, tried to use it as a navigation tool. It's sooo bad. The map freezes, while the meter zone is active and shows the right distance. The route is white color, extremely hard to distinguish from the street. Doesn't know public transport in The Netherlands. Annoying compass thingy that is not possible to disable.",,
379,"Please don't load random entries at startup of this app. It unnecessarily takes more times, data traffic and computer power. And I can easily make a frustration when I use an edit box on the top of this app to search things after 10 seconds or more.",,
380,Very difficult to search between places The Maps always shows the place we are now and to find the route to other place is very tough as the search button is not there like in Android Maps.. And cannot search route between two other places... Not a great app ....,,
381,"It's been a very handy and useful app, and from the functional point of view continues to be. But I'm VERY disappointed with the latest update which started to show me ads in the Bookmark's pane. It is really annoying (especially animated ads) and eats valuable space. I would rather buy a paid version of the app, instead of being forced to see ads in the app I use a lot. Please consider removing ads or introducing a paid version of the app without any ads, instead of turning into yet another ad",,
382,"No advantages over the browser I think Chrome is better for reading Wikipedia. Page organization is almost identical. And Google search for an article title provides suggestions for similar titles. This app says ""there is no such article"". So why use the app?",,
383,"Usually prefer OSMand for its richer feature set, but maps.me has everything the casual user needs and looks a lot slicker. One point deduction for badly implemented OSM contribution functions. What kills this app for me is that it's chock full of tracking code that uses whatever you do to profile you and send you targeted ads. Now I use the ""Maps"" fork from F-droid that uses the same maps without all that privacy-invading nastiness.",,
384,"Hmmm... I'm sticking with the mobile website.  When you press the Android ""back"" button in this app, it reloads the previous page from scratch (placing you at the top of the page), rather than remembering your place (and open sub-topics) on the previous page.  This makes it very annoying to follow links and then try to go back to what you were reading earlier.",,
385,"This app becomes more and more idiotic. Stats are badly organized, slow and do not give relevant data. Posting and editing tools are worthless. This last stupid update is enough for me. Uninstall. Edit: I used this app for stats, and implementing ""Insights"" was bad! Loading is slow and with the last update you cannot view individual posts. New Wordpress post editor in a browser lacks a lot options, in app even more: options missing concerning pictures, buttons for formatting hidden... 500 limit",,
386,"I loved the app, but now it deleted my article I use the app frequently to write while I am traveling. I just spent an hour to compose an article. I needed to check a link on chrome and went back to the main menu. It said local draft saved. I looked up what I needed and went back into the app. In the preview the pictures have been scrambled with the text, an issue I had observed already, which I did not really care about that much. When I tried to edit it, there was no more content, everything gone except for the heading. Everything was deleted.",,
387,"Cant connect Could be good but its useless due to the problem with establishing connection. I have to reload 10 times for my post list update. Its the same with pages, stats, publishing a post, even with login. I tested this on many wifis, with data on, on different devices, ... Same problem everywhere. Fix it and ill give you 4 stars. UPDATE: if i could id rate this app -5. Its pure crap. I was writing a long post, but this app only (due to its problems with connection) only saved the first paragraph. Uninstalled.",,
388,"Nearly no function worked properly. The app updated older versions of post drafts so that the recent progress was deleted. The draft mode does not show contents like lists or images. Uninstalled. The mobile bowser version works fine, while the app is causing more problems than is solves.",,
389,"This app would not let me change my screen name, that IT picked. There is a  function for this but it just doesn't work. I typed in what I wanted, hit  okay, and absolutely nothing changed! I tried 3 times! I tried to delete my  account so I could start over but you can't do that either!!!! After y give  your password for the delete you get a message saying type delete in all  caps to delete but all you get is an okay buttons not a freaking keyboard  to DO what was asked, then you are just back at the damn menu again, WITH  NOTHING CHANGED! USELESS!!!!!!!!!!!!!",,
390,"The best maps in terms of details, but two things are so irritating that they ruin everything for me : 1) it takes very long to create a route, 30 seconds and more for a straightforward route is normal 2) when searching for a location and the point is shown on the map and you decide to zoom out/in to have a better view of the area, the point disappears and you have to search again to get back to the location.",,

392,"I'm a fan of Maps.me, but I cannot use the latest version. The screen freezes, on sartup then the app crashes (same on Redmi 3 & Samsung tab). Clear cache, data, old maps , or uninstall doesn't fix. Have gone back to 7.3.7.",,
393,Was good until latest update The app was fantastic until the newest update.. Now everytime it reloads I have to go searching for the last article I was reading and scroll through it to get back to my place which makes it a gigantic pain. The home screen is fine but it wipes my tabs out every bloody time I relaunch the app.. Wikipedia needs to fix this ASAP,,
394,"I have been using this app for several years. It was very good but has become less reliable as time has passed. I was beginning to think it was my phone developing a problem but I know have a new one and there are still fundamental issues. It can't find my home street or several major roads in London ( eg Holloway Road, Oxford Street) and regularly fails to get a route due to application errors, dumping me off the coast of Africa. Tried deleting and reloading but no better. Time to try other apps",,
395,very very slow download of a 100mb file. a 56k dial up is faster! cant make any route example from a to b bec it need map download but it cant download bec its very slow.! are you kidding me? i haver steady data connection. anything else loads asap. only this app is doing nothing. your respond is a joke!,,
396,"This sad app takes over a couple hours to make an account,Sometimes it can take days until you just get banned for trying to much.If I may say, if nobody noticed teachers ask you not to use this app for research.Lots of people keep ruining pages that took hours to make.I now perfer to use google dictionary or just a regular dictionary.My final words of this paragraph is ""Be all that you can be,you can be great""-laildh.But this app will not.",,
397,"Saving for offline later does not work. In a reading list I will click it, then if I'm in airplane mode they won't load and will tell me to add to a reading list, which I have already done.",,
398,"Please stop notification spam! The app is fine, I even paid for it years ago when it wasn't free (it wasn't cheap either). But I've had the notifications disallowed for it for a long time since the error when you flooded everybody with tons of notifications.

399,"Can't log out ... I am using the app on my Samsung Galaxy 10.1 Tab, I want it to access more than one of the blogs I manage. I got the first blog up, ran a test post, great, went to log out ... can't get it done. The only log out is in the dashboard that I can find, every time I try to get the pull down menu for the log-out I get a screen refresh, meaning I can not get logged out. Without being able to log out of one blog I can't get the other on. Any hints on getting the log out to work?  Other than that it appears to work well, with my first test post that is. I just want to use it for multiple Wordpress blogs.",,
400,"I downloaded this hoping to replace Google maps but unfortunately it's not  there yet, and I'm having to still use Google maps most of the time. This  is mainly because the address search isn't very good, even if you try and  just make it simple and give it a road rather than a postcode a lot of the  time it can't find it. I also dislike that, like, Google maps, the app  tries to hassle me to turn my location on if I start it with my location  off. Otherwise the app is fast and the quality of the map itself is much  better than GM. Edit: an example of a search that doesn't work: ""Calvert  Avenue, London"" this search works on the standard open street map website",,
