1,"Edit: When you use the app as an assistant, it would be nice having a introductory image right before enabling the user to start typing the search query (for a second or so). Also, the refresh icon button is nice - better than a text button - but there is no tabs browsing yet. It would be useful to know what actually changes in the new update when you publish it in the store. [The WebRTC leakage it's still there.]  ---------- Previous Edit ----------  The search widget is back, but it really looks like a basic text box. Also, instead of having a fixed theme (only dark for now), you could give the user a choice to change the theme of the app (along with the widget) - between light and dark, for example. The app is fast and now it can also be used as an assistant, but all the rest still remains unchanged.  ----------  By the way, I've noticed that the app doesn't protect against WebRTC leakage. If you want it to be enabled for the sake of compatibility, okay, but at least give the user a choice to disable it.  ---------- First Review ----------  The old version was better: before it was a nice replacement for Google Search, now it tries to be an alternative to Firefox (Firefox Focus/Klar for the ""Fire Button""). The thing is that it's not enough to be an alternative, since it doesn't have more functionality than the other apps, neither the same. Instead, it's just a web browser with minimal UI (and it can be okay, but...), no search engine-related settings (for instance, DuckDuckGo settings), no browser settings (cookies, JavaScript, Tor...), no tab browsing and management, and no search widget (it was the main function that made me keep ""DuckDuckGo Search"" instead of just using Firefox). To be good, after (re)implementing these functionalities, it could be nice that the search box of the app would replace the one in the DuckDuckGo search results page (if you still want to replace Google Search), otherwise it will be just another web browser."
2,"These past updates r EXACTLY what we DON'T need! Why add ""fireproof"" list, sites change constantly. These are STILL no... ""open in same/new tab"" option, homepage, quick way to close tabs, static address bar, bookmark organization or folders. You have stupid icon colors as an option, but not the stuff above. You also added an annoying animation to the address bar, which completely blocks out the site name until its done playing. Still using firefox until you get with the times. F**king A guys!"
3,"Installed this app after seeing their presentation at Fosdem 2019. Initially I was happily surprised about how it works, but after using it for a while, little annoyances are starting to pile up. While DDG says this browser is focusing in security, the protocol still defaults to https instead of http. Bookmarks cannot be organized. Tab list does not scroll to or highlight current tab. Url bar search doesn't include, let alone prioritize bookmarks. And so on. It's an okay start but work to do!"
4,"Stability Stability Stability Poor performance. Has a 50/50 chance of force closing on you. Use's all my ram. Very sluggish when searching images. Very poor search results at times. Delayed keyboard opening at times too. Also when i click on images the view file button is off screen and if im lucky i can see the top of the file button. Don't add new features just fix the optimization of this App, this should be priority number 1."
5,"I want to love this. I really do.   When I open a PDF, it downloads ok but the url changes to that of the PDF and hitting back, while changing the pages displayed, does not fix the url. I have to type in a new search, and then navigate back to the same page to continue browsing.  I can't hold a link to open in a new tab. Can't seem to find any way to open new tabs, actually. And you of course can't have multiple instances of the app open. That's a deal breaker for me - no tabs is no bueno.   I'd rather pay $10 for a fully featured browser than fight with a single window pane into the internet for free. That plus the bug with the PDF url means that this is not my go-to anytime soon.  Edit: Glad to hear tabs are in development. Two other minor things would be to move the burn button somewhere other than next to the bookmark button - my fat fingers fumble that all the time. Second thing is: why is the address bar font so teensy weensy?"
6,"trash. tabs and using the url bar are a nightmare. terrible tab changing. When changing tabs, it goes straight to url and pulls up the keyboard. I want to see the page not type a url. Wth. I don't get. Am I doing something wrong or is it really that terrible. I've tried a few times, but hopefully ff focus is better. May lack some privacy, but this app is so inefficient I cannot continue to use it. I will continue to use your search in ff focus but your browser is a massive fail. absolute trash"
7,"Since the layout changed you can no longer see the full titles of open tabs except for the first words-which often don't even match the content, it gets confused with the content of other tabs. A double mess so you can't find things. Also, if the search wasnt very recent you can't go back to a previous page. You have to enter the search terms again and again and again to see the other search results. Very frustrating. I wish these issues could be adjusted in the settings."
8,"CURRENT THOUGHTS AS OF 2018-01-26: DuckDuckGo has made a mistake in changing the focus of their app from a search engine to a privacy browser (for which there are options already, such as Firefox Focus). I personally do not use DDG as my primary browser and have no plans to. I feel they should focus on search engine functionality and potentially a voice assistant feature. They should make this privacy browser project a separate app. All things considered, this isn't the app I wanted when I got it originally. It used to get 5 stars, but now it gets 3.  �? ORIGINAL REVIEW: Excellent search engine.    �?   EDIT: I had to remove 3 stars, as the latest update removed a widget for a search engine bar. I will restore to 5 stars when this is returned.    �?   EDIT 2: I have brought the rating to 4 stars because the widget was re-added. However, within the app, the feature that allows you to view a web page in your primary browser is still gone, and so I have not returned it to 5.    �?   EDIT 3: I've tested the functionality of the assistant, and elected to remain with Google assistant, despite my preference for searching with DDG. If increased assistant functionality is added, this would be good (though completely optional and not necessary for me to restore to 5 stars)  �? TL;DR: This is a good search engine but not a great browser."
9,"The new tab system, is terrible, I can no longer quickly find things. Tabs are in little grid boxes, so no room to list page titles - That in the past list view were easier to read. No option to change, no option to roll back to a working version. (The previous, older version was 5 stars!) Frustrating, and equally saddened to experience this step backwards."
10,"Would prefer a home screen with a search field other than the address bar. I guess I'm a bit old school. I would prefer to keep the address bar visible at all times, but I can't find any option to allow that. Also, backing out of tabs doesn't work to go back to a previous screen. Instead, when backing out of a link opened in a new tab, I get the home screen on the new tab rather than the tab I left so I must individually close tabs."
11,It's good but you can improve it. 1. the back button must close de new tab and go to previous page. 2. The tool and address bar must be put at the bottom of the page to reach with one hand. 3. Give more buttons on the toolbar (where is the forward - you don't have to push another button to find it). 4. give me more privacy options. 5. give me an ad blocker. 6. The way you have all the pages opened is not good for one hand use.
12,"It's really fast, but I miss a couple of features. Pinning the menu bar on the bottom instead of the top, leaving the address bar at the top. Switching between tabs by swiping the address bar to the left or right. Quick button for bookmarking website's. Already used DDG as default search engine for years, so going to give this browser a try for the upcoming days/weeks. Also, open new tabs in the background. A quick button to open the startpage. A startpage with buttons to most visited pages."
13,"I tried to use this browser to open links from twitter, etc. so I configured it to delete the complete browser history on exit. However the ""tutorial"" or ""tour"" keeps blocking me from reading the website I opened and I have to complete the steps like tapping the search bar or the privacy grade symbol to continue to read e.g. an article. Unfortunately still happened after about 10 sessions. I would have been fine to complete the ""tour"" once and be done with it to use the browser the way I want but it is frustrating to be interruped on random occasions about ""features"" I don't care about. I became too frustrated and uninstalled it. It would be great to have an option to deactivate the ""tour"" in the settings and just use the browser as is. I liked the rest of the browser performance a lot; sites loaded fast and the Interface was clean (without huge bars at the top and bottom)"
14,"The settings are too minimal, the interface is not intuitive and there are occasional hangs as well. When you land a bad link the entire browser hangs for a couple of minutes. Each link you click by default opens in a new tab so when you press back you land on the new tab page rather than the page you came from. Thats very annoying. How much ever less, all the options available are up top making it terrible for one hand use. Has a lot of scope for improvement."
15,"Alright for the most part. Relatively fast.   1. I'd like to have the option to remember my history.  2. I'd like to see my most visited sites above suggestions in the address bar.  3. On the tabs screen, I expect to be able to swipe tabs left or right to close them.  4. Since the app has the option to close all tabs and delete everything front and center, I'd also like to see the option to Quit (kill) the app in the drop down menu. Maybe with a popup message asking if I want to delete all history/cookies. 5. A text blurb on the Play store page about whether the browser is built on some other source code or built from scratch would be welcome."
16,"You should visit ( BrowserGood. Com ) to install the browser app. It's adblock and very fast! DuckGo! The new tab system, is terrible, I can no longer quickly find things. Tabs are in little grid boxes, so no room to list page titles - That in the past list view were easier to read. No option to change, no option to roll back to a working version. (The previous, older version was 5 stars!) Frustrating, and equally saddened to experience this step backwards"
17,"[...] compared to other browsers, UX is abysmal. It lacks basic functions (some of which have been noted by other users). The most annoying is that there's no way to structure bookmarks (ever heard of folders?) and there's no way to export them (txt file, json file, etc.). Update: the tile view for tabs is unusable with > 3 tabs open and there's no option to go back to the list view. Also think about this: ""Tab preview"" vs. ""the privacy browser"". You just took a wrong turn..."
18,"I really wanted to like this application, but after two days of use it's very clear, this need some serious work to be considered a top browser. * No pull-down to refresh * if you have more than one tab open and hit the back button, you won't go to the tab was opened previously, but it'll take you out of the app completely. * no customization option to get the tabs accessible from the bottom of the screen or the top. which makes it hard to use in large screen phones."
19,"Really tested this app to see its capabilities. Good so far with some complaints. It doesn't block pop ups very well. Pop ups get through as another tab opened in the background. I haven't found a setting for that yet. Also, backing out doesn't bring you to the original search page, which sucks. Playing videos within the app won't allow for auto landscape/portrait adjustment. Overall, the app is ok, but I would really like to see more improvements."
20,"The Key board is hit and miss to come up when tapping in a search box. Back issue still happening, browser seems to go stale randomly where it doesnt do anything, all the buttons respond so it's not frozen but they dont do anything no pages will load have to completely close all tabs and close the browser right out and start over. Lots of major bugs still need worked out."
21,"Not intuitive to use... I asked for a simple search by words (no URL) in the search area on top of the tab. Each time I got a blank page, ""No results found"" ... When I just wrote down ""orange"", still ""No results"" and the white page... Really ? I am very surprised by all the positive comments, after trying for 5min to get results from the search I was focused on, and still getting nothing (and especially not intuitively) I uninstalled the app. ... I go back to Opera"
22,"You should visit ( BrowserGood. Com ) to install the best browser app. It's adblock and fast. Removed a star because I am logged out of everything after the update! SUPER annoying. The new thumbnail view should be optional, plus the images are all screwed up. I think people are expecting a full fledged browser, and that's unrealistic. That said, the tab organization/selection could be way better"
23,"I downloaded DuckDuckGo on all of my Android devices, and I'm quite enjoying it so far. I feel a lot more secure nowing that DuckDucGo blocks trackers and deletes my browsing history when I close the app. It is very fast, straight forward to use, and very accessible with the TalkBack screenreader for blind and visually impaired users. However, I'm only able to give it 3 stars as it's missing a very important feature - the ability to synchronize bookmarks across multiple devices. Please include!"
24,"Pretty good with some flaws. Would like text reflow for reading articles. Would like the app buttons moved to the bottom of the screen. Have had several instances, on a variety of sites, of the app freezing up. Had to close the app and clear the cache to get it to work again. An option for bookmarks on the home page would be nice. I've made DDG my default browser and enjoy the quickness and lack of ads while surfing the web."
25,"Edit: some other issues.. please let us change the default search engine. there's something wrong with the Clear Data button. It takes at least a couple minutes to complete, during which time all apps are unresponsive. I do like the simplicity, the lack of ads, and the privacy features. One bug that bugs me is clicking a link that downloads a file seems to download the file in the background with no progress or completion indicators/notifications."
26,"Since the browser has messed up the autofill saves, how does one delete them and start again ? One thing that definitely needs to change is when one opens a link on one page, and a new tab opens to view the new page, when the back button is pressed the just opened tab should *NOT* just remain at the default view but should close and return the user to the tab where the link was pressed. Having to tidy up from this *every single time* is beyond all reason."
27,"I like it, the privacy and info it provides... but on my phone it's hard to use. It opens so many pages in a new window, I have a hard time finding where I am. Sometimes I look up and I'll have 15-20 separate windows open and I have to close them all. Also, wish I could turn on the ability to use my microphone for speech to text. I realize the privacy issues but sometimes I need to get a long message in and can't sit there and any type it all in on my phone. Too much work, back to Chrome."
28,It's missing too many options to be a useful browser. No home button and no possibility to open browser in home page every time. Also why does it delete all browser settings when I clear browsing data with the fire button? That's just frustrating.
29,"I love this app but for the past couple of months it freezes several times every day. All tabs freeze and it won't let me open anything in new tabs. I have to completely close the app and start over. I've done a system update and app update, and the problem still continues. Also the back button rarely takes you back to the last page and only opens a blank page. Pinterest links to open in browser no longer open in DuckDuckGo and redirect to a blank page."
30,"Great for privacy but the change from a list view to large flat icons for each Tab view in the Nov 2019 update is as close to a deal breaker as you can get. I don't want slabs of preview icons, I want non-truncated URLs. Updated to add: Dec 2019 the large flat random-picture real estate-eating preview bookmark icons are still REALLY ANNOYING AND UNINFORMATIVE. Usability has been lost with no gain in other aspects of use of this app. PLEASE bring back the list view."
31,"There is absolutely no way to organize or import bookmarks. All bookmarks are just dumped into one folder that can not be sorted in any way. This needs a 1x1 voice search widget. The current ""search"" widget takes up too much room, even when resized and just opens the app. What's the point of that? I can open the app myself with the app's 1x1 icon. You just created a larger redundant widget. Apparently not much thought was put into this apps design. Also navigating multiple tabs is a real pain."
32,"You should visit ( BrowserGood. Com ) to install the best browser app. It's adblock, privacy and fast! I really wanted to love this! After u enter something to search it doesn't return back enough up-to-date relevant options. I'm been entering the same info into DuckDuckGo and Google and they just don't compare. The last search I did only pulled up 2 relevant stories and 1 was from October and they were from no name sites"
33,"So I woke up this morning, and immediately noticed that my ddg search widget was gone from my home page. My first thought was that google had wised up and removed it for being so  much better than their own search app. That is definitely no longer the case though. Apparently the devs saw fit to push an update that completely changed the app from being a absolutely fantastic search app with full integration of the features that make ddg great (like that 'bang' button) , to a mediocre 'privacy' themed web browser, losing any reason i would have to keep using them. I don't know why they have done this, but I'm not at all happy with it, and they only reason they get two stars from me during these dark days is because of the years of excellent use i've gotten from them *as a freaking search engine*. I'm sure this new browser thing would have a market, hell, i probably would have given it a shot, but you should have released it seperately, not replaced your already stellar search app."
34,I enjoy the privacy features however the functionality is severely lacking. When trying to open links in a new tab it will open the image file instead. Copying text is hit or miss. There is no way to prevent redirects. These are very basic functions that are missing.
35,Good overall but needs a FIX the tabs page is very poorly setup. When you open the tabs list it doesn't open to the current tab it opens to the top which makes navigation difficult when you have 10 or 20+ tabs open. Please model after the chrome tab setup or a more user friendly tab layout. Great otherwise. appreciated.
36,"Still a good app but recent updates have me searching for another. Several updates ago changed opened tabs to tiles. More recently, opening images, links that open in new tab/windows and downloads open a tab that you have to manually close and then navigate back to the ""active"" tab. That's just annoying. Pressing back repeatedly use to close the ""active"" tab, then the app. Now, if you open multiple external links from email and then press back to the email, you end up with a bunch of open tabs."
37,Fast Too bad there's no option to have search input box focused at start-up even when Home Screen is set to Stories (default). Holding menu button (search) makes the menu slide left and right several times before search is activated. Widget offers nothing you can't get from a lighter and smaller app shortcut - no interactivity or feature. Widget design breaks when resized to 2x1 or 1x1.
38,"Duckduckgo app will NOT open ANY embedded link in YouTube app video as most, if not all, break the HTTPS/HTTP encryption chain violating duckduckgo's security policy. This FORCES a duckduckgo freeze as the default browser and revert to Firefox or Chrome as default which 1) defeats the intent of security because each dump their ""slime trail"" to mama and 2) is EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING and involves a GREAT DEAL of monkey motion in system setup tools just to get, as example, a recipe ingredient list."
39,"It is great to finally have a browser that can easily clean up after itself. One tap and your history, cache and all the traces are gone. Well, that was the theory at least. The problem is that even after I tapped the burning button - the app was still registering over 200 mb of user data stored on my device. Cleaning it via the storage settings, aside from removing the bookmarks had no other effect on it. Edit: After several weeks the storage app uses still keeps growing and I have no idea why."
40,"Search bar at the top is lacking. No back or forward button? To find a website I've saved, I must do several clicks to get into my bookmarks section and then locate the one I want? How about a favorite websites option of some sort? Also, the parental controls I have set do not like duckduckgo app or search engine - what's up with that? I like the idea of this app and the tracker blocking + info, but it could be a bit more user friendly."
41,"Duckduckgo seems like a great privacy oriented alternative to other browsers, however, I'd really like to see a couple of options added in the settings menu: 1. Being able to have the address/navigation bar at the bottom of the screen so that I can reach it on my giant phone 🙂 2. Make the theme of the app follow the system's theme instead of having it manually set to either light or dark. There is probably more smaller features I'd like to see added for this to be my default browser."
42,"Honestly, I was loving DuckDuckGo. I used it for all my web searches. But ever since the recent update, I haven't been able to search anything. It keeps showing""error : name not resolved"" and doesn't give any results even with a perfectly fine network connection. I'm sorry, but I can't give a 5 star rating unless the app does what it's supposed to. Devs, fix this."
43,"i hope you fix it, some website have pop up Ads attached to the video you want to watch... chrome if there pop ads attach to the video it will open for new tab to continue the ads and previous tab is still open until it plays the video... duckduckgo if there pop ads attach, it will open a new tab and close the previous tab or continue the ads on the same tab and the website I'm on, it will close so i need to retype again again again won't be able play the video?"
44,CAN ONLY USE CLIPBOARD ONCE PER NEW BROWSER PAGE. STILL NO NIGHT MODE OPTION FOR WEB PAGES. DO THEY REALLY CARE/LISTEN ABOUT PEOPLES FEEDBACK? WHEN CLEARING ALL DATA AND OPENING NEW BROWSER PAGE I NOTICED ONE OF THE PREVIOUS WEB SEARCHES!!!??? WAS NOT DELETED. I DONT TRUST THE PRIVACY AND WOULD PREFER THE OPTION TO DELETE MY OWN DATA.
45,"It's good for what it does and within its intentions, however after using it some time there's a few things that annoy me about it. The first one it the way it just takes you right back out of the search randomly when you press the back button. Say you go on images and press back sometimes it will take you back to the previous page, but others is takes you out completely and you have to type into the sesrch again. Also the keyboard changes layout when you open the app."
46,"Very good browser with some common features missing. Namely... * pull down to refresh the page * Options to put bookmarks or favourites or frequently visited or recently visited or SOMETHING on the new tab homescreen. EDIT: Also, no 'share to printer' feature, and a list of 'valid domains' pops up randomly in a window, covering the keyboard. Furthermore, 'back' from a tab with no history just goes to a blank page, rather than closing the tab and returning to the previous one."
47,"Buggy and needs some redesigns on the UI. Every time I switch between tabs, it automatically selects the address bar and my keyboard pops up. Why? It should just go to the screen I'm viewing. ""Open in background tab"" launches the tabs in reverse order from every other browser. Selecting different tabs is way too sensitive and you can easy swipe to close the tab instead of selecting it. There's also no way to recover it. App crashes with lots of tabs open. By comparison I don't have the same crash issues with Firefox or Chrome. You should be able to change the multiple-tab view to list instead of gallery. If you get a pop-up tab, you can't hit the back button to get to your original screen--you have to hit the tabs button, close your new tab, and then swipe to return to the original one you were reading."
48,Everyone can visit WEB: ( BrowserGood. Com ) to install the best browser app. It's BLOCK ADS and FASTER. I trust DDG search engine and use it on all my devices be it PC or Handheld devices. I just dowloaded this app on my android now and used it for about 10 minutes. Noticed too many and too frequent intrusive ads. Which by the way moves me from my current tab and takes me to the new tab by force
49,"New update is a disaster. Auto-suggest only gives me my own bookmarks, not other suggestions. Also takes twice the time to shut down. Obviously not well tested before release. Am now looking for another Android browser that isn't a waste of time. Don't see easy rollback of update and used to be satisfied with DuckDuckGo. No longer."
50,"EDIT: the search widget was brought back, but none of the old features were. I don't need another web browser. Because of this, I'm uninstalling.  The latest update ruined the app. It removed everything that made DDG for Android so great: the search widget, opening links in another browser, the news feed, and tons of other useful features and settings. It went from being a full-fledged search engine app, to being a watered-down web browser with very limited capabilities. What were you thinking devs??? This was a horrible decision! Updates are supposed to fix and add features, not get rid of them all overnight. P.S., for those of you that want to get the old version back, you can get it on APKMirror."
51,"The back arrow goes back to home and I have to find the tab again and reopen. When I tried to leave feedback through your play store link, it just did a web search for feedback. Ridiculous. The auto blocking of trackers makes me want to keep this around but if I can't even use the back button then this belongs in the trash."
52,"There's no way to access history even for the tab you're currently in, and It's quite annoying that if you press the back button one too many times the tab closes. But what is unforgivable is that one wrong click when trying to open a new tab, closes every single tab. This is absolutely unworkable as a main browser. Doesn't even seem that great for privacy as there is no embedded vpn or encryption. Your ISP clearly sees most of the sites you visit from here, along with your real IP."
53,"Overall-Great app for those who seek privacy in the Internet. However, it's not that convenient to use. The main thing that annoys me is inability of browser to close tabs automatically. Let me explain. You click a link and the browser opens it in the new tab. You read the material and then you want to get back to the previous tab. You click ""back"" and you get to the empty new tab + you need to search for the tab you came from (sometimes that tab is not the last one on the list). Pls, fix this!"
54,"I have used this for a couple weeks now. There is lots of good stuff with  this browser. Privacy, and the search itself are particularly strong  points. Definitely very important to browse privately and I appreciate this  feature over all other brands. There are some quirky things that make this  a bit harder to use than it should. The biggest issue is that the keyboard  pops up when you start the browser or open a tab. That makes you have to  dismiss the keyboard before you can access bookmarks. In most browsers, if  you go back repeatedly you eventually hit the home page. Here you get back  to the home page but it seems to keep a tab of the last site? I ended up  with probably 10 open tabs from one session never having opened a new tab  somehow. Last, it's a bit slower than some other browsers. I sometimes  click back twice thinking I didn't touch in the right place, but I did, so  I skip too many pages back by accident. So I will use this app for  important and private things, and maybe another browser with DDG as my  search engine for more casual use."
55,"Well, good bye once and for all.  They disabled 'Stories' even on the old versions now, and although they updated the app description on F-Droid the new app is not available there.  So it's uninstalled.  For those of you looking for a full featured privacy browser that has multiple tabs and massive bookmark capability with DuckDuckGo as a search engine, I use Lightning (the good version is available on F-Droid).  It is a bit tricky to set up, but wonderful working and very light on memory."
56,"The only thing DDG has going for it is privacy, but that is an illusion as long as it is American owned and hosted. It uses Bing and other third party sites to gather its results (look at their own policy and see) so the only thing they give you is a search field with worse results than their sources. Startpage can do that with both better privacy and results directly from Google, which is of course light years ahead, and Qwant can do so with both much better privacy and much better search results without using Google and  it's European based and owned. Using an American search engine for privacy is like peeing your pants for warmth! It might work but....."
57,"Edit: I'm changing this from 5 to 1 star until they add the ability to create FOLDERS and manage your BOOKMARKS. I've been sending them numerous emails through their feedback channel, but no response nor action. The devs just don't care about user feedback. How hard is it? I mean when you are using this as your primary browser, you're gonna have a lot of bookmarks, so you need to be able organize them into folders!"
58,"Two issues I have: 1. Social media embedded links are not showing for me. It briefly shows the link, then it fails to load/embed the link and it leaves a blank space. It was working fine until maybe a week ago, but it's now happening for every embedded link. 2. On the mobile app, there is no option to open a link in the same tab, which can be frustrating having to close a tab after every link clicked. Running Android v10 on Nokia 9"
59,"This app is good for what it is, a web browser that tells you it does not keep a record of your internet navigation but it certainly lacks at least one feature other browsers have: pop up windows do spawn in the current tab you are using wich is very inconvenient. Also, it would be really really nice if full screen option for video playback could display such media in horizontal mode without the need of activate the auto rotation feature in phone's settings."
60,"Consistently FAILS to download files, can not name the files downloaded, can not choose into which sub-folder files are downloaded, can not search for images by image, consistently receiving error messages upon clicking links, webpages refusing to x-out when clicked appropriately, can not import/export bookmarks to/from other browsers, extremely user-unfriendly with an excruciatingly buggy UI. And I've had this app for less than a day! `Eff` this trash! Uninstalled!"
61,"Still some issues with 2.0.22 Back nav is working to some extent, but there's still an annoying bug which can render the app unusable. Steps to reproduce: Enter search terms. Go. Click a result. While viewing, use task manager to look at another app. Do same to go back to DDG. Now I'm on home screen with search terms in top bar, but can't use them; submitting does nothing. Click a cooler item, the URL appears in top bar, but doesn't go there. Have to clear the app and start again. Request: back & forward buttons."
62,"Just installed this as an alternative to Google due to Google's left leaning search results. Can't rate its performance yet but I will once I've tried it out for awhile. It's nice to find an alternate browser/search engine that respects our privacy.  Edit: 1 potential issue I see is that the fire button is so close to the menu button that I could see possibly hitting it by accident. Hopefully it asks you to confirm before deleting tabs, etc."
63,"Works, but severely lacking features for it to completely replace chrome. Downloading is broken,there is no downloads manager, and copying/cutting URLs don't even register. The concept of DuckDuckGo is gold as a search engine, but their implementation of a browser feels like a shoddy attempt to market their service. Stay away from this browser unless you don't do much downloading and/or url copy/pasting in your daily usage."
64,"phone, yes- tablet....not so much! lowering to 2 star, as browser works perfectly on my phone, but on my tablets, it's very very glitchy. since Android Pie update, bookmarks don't work, and open tabs disappear when minimized (although they still show up in the list of open tabs). tablet is also mysteriously missing the bottom menu completely. and- your 'feedback' link points to a community support site- not a way to report problems. popups not completely blocked either."
65,"The idea is great. I use the search engine as a browser app. As a phone app it's also great with one problem: going back on pages seems to be stuck and is not a time lag. It just doesn't react around 4 out of 10 times. Then naturally you press one more time and it goes all the way back to the empty starting page and not one step back as intended. Otherwise this woukd be great. (reported this bug in the in-app-system) Edit: recently, it's not possible to open a new tab. If you press 'open empty new tab', the old tab is replaced with a new empty one and the old content is gone. This makes this browser almost useless."
66,"It hangs.Most of the time while going back to the previous page(still opened) it shows a blurred or totally blank page, that you do not have any option to manage it because toolbar or setting icon and new tab opening icon is too disappeared. Thus you have the only option to close the browser and finish the entire ongoing task or session and You will need a fresh start. So harassing.."
67,Back doesnt work... If u press back to go to previous web page. Instead... It opens a new blank tab. Extremley annoying. Worked fine a few months ago. I habe tested this now on 2 totally different android phones. Same issue. Now the browser is basically useless. Emailed support twice about it and nobody bothers to reply.
68,"Ironic this is called a ""PRIVATE Browser"" because the searches in it are not private in any form. For context, when users search with DDG, their search terms appear both in their Search URL and in their Browser History. Anyone with access to a user's computer or mobile device can view their searches, in plain-text in their Browser History. Privacy by itself means that the most private settings are enabled by default. DDG has failed on their privacy promises."
69,"Ads were blocked, everything was cleared on exit; it seemed like I had found the perfect app to use and keep my searches private. But after a few months I started getting scam pop-ups. At first I dismissed it but now it has become a recurring issue and I can't seem to do any of my work without being instantly opened to another tab so someone can scam me. I'm very disappointed, this app had so much potential."
70,"Clean app but what is the point in having little to no customizable settings, no option to have a home page and no option to have a page where you can pin your most used sites for easy access? I dont like the fact that it automatically switches to a new tab and I cant change that in settings as there is no option. And why is there no history? I know its a privacy browser but it should at least be an option. Also it has problems where the page doesnt load sometimes and has an error saying that."
71,"The latest update was a major step backwards, at least on the phone app. I used to be able to focus a picture with a button in the corner that is now gone, leaving fuzzy images fuzzy. In addition, the swiping motion sometimes doesn't register. It seems that in order to compensate, the motion to swipe up or down, which discards the pic and brings you back to the full page, is hair-trigger sensitive.  The Settings have been dulled down so far that I can only customize whether or not I want my suggestions to autocompleted. Before this update, I could choose if I wanted privacy mode on, to enable cookies or not, and in general make my browsing experience unique. Now, that has all been stripped away in exchange for an overly sensitive browser that needs serious fixing."
72,"This app is useless. In order to use it I have to install chrome. No site will let me in unless I install the data chasing app from google. This is NO secure app and intend to let everyone know this and to stay away. I have recieved facebook adds which is also ran by google so explain that. You say you're a stand alone service yet all results I have looked for requires chrome to open. Don't get taken in by what the app promises, its all a smoke screen to fool you."
73,"I like the privacy, but it's function needs work. If I search for pictures, then click on one, then back, then click another, then back, etc, for some reason it seems to create a chain. If I wish you go back to the original search by hitting the back button, it will take be through the ENTIRE chain of pictures I clicked on. Normal browsers would essentially reset the chain if I looked at a picture and then hit back, so I wouldn't have to hit the back button a hundred times."
74,"Loved it, used it for 2 weeks then uninstalled it. Great for privacy but cannot do even the basic things right, eg. Doesn't open or download linked PDFs easily, doesn't render a lot of web pages correctly, doesn't have a browsing history, I understand the privacy but you could atleast keep a local private history. If you close a page and don't remember the link, it's gone forever."
75,Instead of a light theme... How about something useful... Perhaps fitting the page on a mobile device when you zoom in ( so you don't need a magnifying glass to read. Nothing more annoying than scrolling back and forth to read a paragraph! And yes..... Other mobile web browsers do just that. Keep working on it please.
76,I'd like to be able to close tabs by clicking the back button and going back to the previous tab instead of going back to home screen and closing the app when I press the back button again. This would allow me to search and close tabs at a faster rate in a much shorter amount of time. I like everything else. Moving the ( open background tab )option up a bit in the options list would be helpful too but that's not a huge concern for me.
77,"I really like this browser. However it has a lot of options and features that I don't understand. I am learning as I go, but I've already lost tabs I wanted to keep by having chosen the wrong setting. My fault but still annoying. I do really LOVE the fact that it shows me the trackers it has blocked and that it can make whatever sight I'm on safer. Will upgrade stars when and if I figure out how to use this browser effectively. Overall a really nice, fast browser."
78,"I believed that this app truly cares about privacy, but I felt one area to  be creepy. I make a search on the duckduckgo browser app, open the search  result, then clear all tabs and data. After a while, I did the same search  only to find out that the website i last visited through the search result  is now marked in purple indicating that it's already visited. When all my  tabs and data are cleared, how does this app know the website I visited  before?"
79,"It works fine as a web browser, but you sometimes miss the search ability of google when using this, the part you've replaced. It is so much better to search for places around you, movie theaters times, weather, and specific information on google (to name a handful). For example, if you googled sunset it would give you the answer right there, but with this you go into search results to find the answer. So I guess what I'm saying is that you are compromising for track-free web browsing."
80,"This is not a good app. The search results are horrible and do not compare to Google's search results. Also, hitting the ""back"" button closes the app instead of bringing you back to the previous page. The UI is ugly, and there is no refresh button. Not much effort put into this at all. Inconvenient and clunky."
81,"Not anonymous, it it was, even after closing my tabs and buring the history, why do you get notifications telling me how many trackers I blocked etc. This happens when I'm not using duckduckgo at that time. You obviously know where I have been if you know what trackers you blocked hours, days, after I cleared my tabs. This company tracks. You can't even configure the settings so it says it all. Also the fingerprint of your device is still accessible to webpages. No protection against web rtc etc"
82,"Great browser but now after the last update i experience a weird bug. Everytime i open a new toolbar and type something into the search bar, the page appears to be blank unless i open settings menu and come back to the toolbar. Then everything is shown as it should. I've tried rebooting, clearing cache and even reinstalling the app. The problem still lingers on and it's annoying."
83,"This browser gets me different search results than Google Chrome on my Android phone, which is great, but it somehow still allows through the Facebook popup ads that I hate so much. Would the developers please provide the ability to block all popup ads, including those from Facebook and Comcast?"
84,"A nightmare!!! Can't use swiping in search bar because it runs all the letters together. Can't download from a site with a download link. No directions for how to use the app within the app. There might have been a tutorial when I first downloaded it, but for someone with brain injuries, I need to be able to refer back to directions or the tutorial several times before it clicks in my mind. There's a long list of issues and not enough room here to list them all. JUNK! JUNK! JUNK!"
85,Good to have at least one browser that is privacy oriented. However following features are required for better experience: Videos should not auto-play; Gesture to navigate between open tabs; Ability to open a new website from bookmarks in an existing tab (currently opens a new tab); Tabs opened in background should load the links automatically; Loading a site on an empty tab via bookmarks & then pressing back just closes the browser instead of going back to the empty tab
86,"Latest update downloaded 18th of August, still broken. New tabs load (progress bar completes) but page is blank/white, have to press the tab button at the top and go select the same page for content to appear."
87,Almost a perfect browser. A few things are still missing. 1. Can not refresh/reload the page when I pull down the screen. So I have to reach up to the address bar or to the 3 dots on the top right corner and do it manually. In a big phone this is not comfortable at all. 2. No option to manually turn on and off to block the trackers and the ads. 3. The cloud save does not sync my bookmarks 4. No fingerprint lock Hopefully you guys fix these in the near future. Thx
88,"immature with bugs sufferred routinely like latest being inability to cancel 3rd party app request popping up preventing anything else from being done in even new tabs.... i also need a search engine as only bing is offered now instead of selected text being searched by browser the right mouse lol button search command used to pass for ""web"". when i can use browser again without flushing present tabs i will add stars... till then avoid use as browser but if possible use ducks search..."
89,"Search results have greatly improved! Is there any way to incorporate voice to text without compromising user privacy? Would really like to have voice to text. Biggest recommendation is to move the search box and controls to the bottom of the screen for ease of use, like Yandex browser. After viewing an image, selecting back arrow will often exit you from that search. Major pain."
90,"The address bar should either hide automatically after loading page or be fixed and not hide at all. Otherwise I can't see web page bottom bar which is sticked to the bottom of the page. It's super annoying. Especially when I use a web app, which has there an important feature like responding to a message contained in a bottom bar. In this case the element is ""displayed"" outside of the screen until I scroll up. It happens even if the page would fit perfectly in other browser without scrolling."
91,"Could be better. I'm continually dissappointed whenever I update the app and discover that my bookmarks still aren't automatically displayed when I open a new tab. Also, I wish that I could change the default text size on webpages, force non-mobile sites to wordwrap (like ddowiki), and have a text only browsing experience option. It's still better than the alternatives (like Chrome or Firefox), which are frankly heinous, though so I'll keep using it despite my dissappointments for now."
92,"Why is DuckDuckGo Dependant On Google Chrome? This app worked perfectly fine until I uninstalled Google Chrome from my device. Now, all of a sudden this app won't run anymore. So tell me, why is a company like yours who claims to be the biggest protector of user privacy, dependant on the biggest violater of it? It makes 0 sense for DDG to require Google Chrome."
93,"Alright, so you removed stories. Nobody really cared about stories anyways, that's fine. Why would you remove the search widget?? Also, why have you removed the ability to start searching by holding home button? This app is a joke now and I'm afraid I have to downgrade. Also, why would you remove an option to open in external web browser? that's a shame"
94,"Great browser, just a couple of niggles, (1) page forward/back &  refresh/home buttons need to be on the stautus bar not hidden in the menu.  (2) Please please please give us the option to import/export our bookmarks  directly from other browsers into duckduck without having to go through  others privacy busting cloud services. and (3) The keyboard popup is very  clunky any chance we can have the option to just slide it up & down  ourselves? Other than that great brouser & search services 😀 next stop  email? 😃."
95,"Hello, I have been using ur browser for past 3-4 months, most of the features are very good like privacy and no tracking, but developers still need to work a lot on ur search engine, its pretty crappy, even after writing specific search criteria it mainly shows the results for US region, because of which I am forced to use google search engine."
96,"I installed this because Google Chrome is now going to censor content..the 1st thinh I got when I clicked on you for my new homepage was a green screnn that says creepy site with a big flame. It wants me to continue to block unwanted tracking..I thought that's what you do..why would you promote something else when that is your claim to fame.Is this legit? I don't like it. I x'd out of it but keep getting it. Please tell me what it is/get rid of it..& I will change the rating..Incidently, I tried your link that says we ""can always reach you"". It took me to a definition of the word feedback. I then went to your site & searched for the creepy site thing but it found nothing & I could not find any way to reach you there..not a great way to start. Just paged all the way down & see an email option..will try that as well."
97,"Edit: Over night the search results have become completely unrelated. I have tried reinstalling and clearing everything. It has become hard to find specific addresses and the right companies. Going to use another browser for while. Best Browser, Best experience. Faster and lighter than chrome or firefox and never fails. This app wont track you and doesnt save history, and there is an option to clear everything when you exit or use the fire icon. I wont use another browser on my phone."
98,"Latest update (Sept): 1) app is broken. Searches don't load. Blank screen. You have to go into a menu and then back out of it in order to see the page. 2) now downloads images as .bin files?! Completely useless - can't be shared on social media apps or edited, etc."
99,"This app is a good start, albiet pretty barebones. However my main concern, in my settings: Automatically clear: Tabs and data; Clear on: App exit only. This feature has been very unreliable for me (on Android 9). I have tried exiting the app by opening task manager, then swiping up the application to remove it. Sometimes when I reopen to app, the old tabs are there, sometimes not. Maybe add an option to the 🔥 button: clear all tabs/data AND close app. Would be nice instead of two actions."
100,"The search engine is excellent, the browser is... passable. Can't print pages, can't override local certificate errors (have to use Chrome to access my router, which defeats the purpose of having a privacy browser.) Some websites open links in a different but not new tab, overwriting a tab I had opened previously to use later. Can't see whole screen on some websites and can't zoom out to see it. Chrome lets me zoom out. I don't want to ever use Chrome, but for some sites I have to."
101,Trying to upload a picture to my picture hosting site and app keeps shutting down saying it's stopped. Also it won't let me change my keyboard despite me using a third party keyboard I downloaded it keeps on a black keyboard with the incognito on it. I can't type and have that on there too distracting. It creeps me out that a browser that claims you are protected from prying eyes is controlling what keyboard app you use.
102,"Hey, I don't know what happened to the browser but it appears to be broken. Any time I click a link, whether it's sent to me or is on another app, it won't load and gives me an error message; ""Webpage not Available The webpage at (insert whatever link I select) could not be loaded because: net::ERR_CLEARTEXT_NOT_PERMITTED"" How can I fix this?"
103,"getting there Great app, great service. One huge annoyance though is that the user cannot choose to both show only the results page inside the app and open all links in browser. If I choose ""open in external browser"", the search results also open in the  external browser and I can't do things like save searches in the app. If I turn this option off then I have to browse within the app which does not provide normal browser features like bookmarking and data options."
104,"The things that make this app unusable for me are it's inability to have several tabs open, lack of in browser back/ forward button, inability to search keywords on the page, and worst of all, that it displays pages inorrectly (Instead of viewing a page normally it squished the page into a slender strip of jumbled text and no images, making it impossible to use.) The search page is also displays results in an undesirable order. (For example, searching for a business should yield the company's website, not a forum talking about the business)"
105,"constant slow loading speed, empty search results, links not working and limited settings ruin this app. I thought this ran on bing's search engine, but compared results tell a different story. The results I do get, I'm only able to actually click on 1/4 of them without toggling the privacy protection to load them. Now it's making me leave the app and come back in. It's very annoying doing that on repeat for clicks that are incredibly delayed and turn the page white from not loading. Broken...."
106,"Despite the developer's description, it does NOT use https unless you manually type it in. It only has a few options, none of which are important or especially useful. It seems like they started to make a browser, but forgot to finish it. There's not much to recommend, unfortunately. However, their search website is still great, in my opinon."
107,"This is a bare bones browser. The tracking protection is nice, but other apps can give me the same thing with many more features. I cannot save pictures to my device, can't open multiple tabs, there isn't a ""request desktop"" option, no bookmarks, no find in page, etc. I had this for only a few days before it frustrated me to the point of uninstalling. I'll stick with your search engine instead. There's a lot of room for improvement with this app."
108,"Crashes and gets stuck. For around a week its crashed on a webpage and froze , i had to hard shutdown my phone . Then everytime i tried to start the app it kept trying to reload the last site and crashed frerzing my Samsung s6 . Had to uninstall and reinstall. If it crashes again i will delete the cache and data from app setting (never thought of that until now ) . If it was a true private browser then your history would be deleted by default and i would never have had this problem ."
109,"Since I've been using DuckDuckGo, I have had more security breaches -- including exposure and subsequent spamming of my last private email address that I use to conduct business, received emails containing content involving a medical procedure I recently had (and I have ALWAYS kept my microphone disabled in ALL apps except my calling app), an attempted Twitter hack (I haven't logged in to Twitter in 5 years), and a stolen debit card number -- than I have ever had in my history of using the web."
110,"I do like the security and no bs aspect of the app and love the search engine, however a request to the devs would be to make an option where opening something in a new tab doesnt automatically leave your current one and take you to the new then when you try to go back to your previous tab it bring you to the top of the list and you have to scroll to find the tab you want. If you changed that i would instantly rate 5 stars. Thank you"
111,"Doesn't work well with vpns, isn't as unbias in it's search results as it was, thinking of changing to a browser with more integrity, so I get more organic results and not just a long list of fake mainstream news sites, which no one trusts anymore. The search is now unusable almost, it wasn't when I started using it, something has changed, which is a shame."
112,"Does not work very well, quits responding and i have to close it. Query returns are not very good lots of returns are marked as ads in results. This used to be a good browser now not so much. I have removed and reinstalled it thinking it got corrupted, continues to have same query results"
113,"Browser has many versioning, unsafe redirects, and UI issues. Website asks for donations but has removed the support forum. DDG subscribes the user to popups and advertisements, but doesnt inform users when it redirects or sends data as http vs. https. DDG App requires Bandwidth/mobile data to report screen Error/issues, but doesnt provide a ticket number/resolution. A 5 star review can be edited to a 3. How can I help you help me.. or should i uninstall?"
114,It was amazing and my go to search engine for a long time. Latest update made it so I can no longer watch videos full screen and the widget they added back just leaves a black bar on my screen. Even after I uninstalled.   It says null at the bottom and when I click it automatically goes to play store to redownload. I can't get it to go away so something is very wrong and I've never seen an app affect my device even after uninstall.
115,"Everybody can visit: ( BrowserGood. Com ) to install the best browser app. It's ADBLOCK...Issues to fix. Sometimes downloading stops and show error notification, while same thing downloads smoothly using Google chrome. It would be better if you could provide inbuilt powerful advertisement blocker and VPN. Everything else is better than any other browser. Didn't get any response from team on my review so rating it 1 star will edit and give all stars back when my feedback and review get response"
116,"Tried to ID mystery icons; found help/ instructions do not exist; or hidden within privacy boasting ""about"" pages, etc. Too much fluff, not enough dirrection. Poor support at other companies isnt a good excuse to follow suit. The intro help wizard is never enough; communties fail (I wont sign up to another site anyhow)... INDEXING: proven for hundreds of years to work well. other device hates it 8/25/20 I'll still use DDG engine, but in another, working, browser..... Uninstalling 7/11/20"
117,"Everything is great until you have to use the mic too speak for something to post. It shuts down before completed. It will only allow one sentence at a time. With Google I could speak a large paragraph and Google would remember it and later post where ever u want it. Another problem is if for instance you have completed this whole paragraph and later needed to add a word by pasteing into the middle of the sentence, this app will erase every word typed before and only keep the newly pasted word (using duck duck go). Which is fustation typing to retype a whole paragraph all over again. Also some of the menu items such as downloading is hard to find and operate. In this sense this is not user friendly. I miss being able to use this app to save into another app such as saving a recipe into notepad. It does not inter work with other apps. For these reasons I am uninstalling this browser."
118,I like DuckDuckGo for search. I like my browser to look at web pages. They changed this from a nice DuckDuckGo search widget to a bad browser with no option to open in my chosen browser. They completely removed all the functionality I needed before adding back a little bit (the search widget). This is a cynical attempt to get the people who used their search widget to use their browser. I will be far more wary of trusting DuckDuckGo in any way in the future.
119,"Since last update, a number of issues present: 1.) Results of search field or web address entered do not load into a window/page. Have to select the dropdown menu, which shows the unloaded page as a tab, then select the tab in order to view the page. 2.) Scrolling down inadvertently engages a page reload; feature WAAAY too sensitive. 3.) Can not use the search field in YouTube more than once before having to close the page & opening again. Can not get cursor in search field to type anything!"
120,"It's pretty good, it's like Firefox before they committed suicide with that latest psychotic update but can't access history or anything and it's inconvenient. If I accidentally close a tab it's gone forever. If I visit a site often it doesn't get easier. Not user friendly. Also very annoying is the fire symbol right at the top which asks you if you want to delete all your data and close all the tabs. And every time the split screen is adjusted the page reloads and it's incredibly annoying."
121,"One thing you should take note of before using this app; unless you are exclusively looking for privacy, this app should NOT be the replacement to your already existing browser. As a ""privacy browser"", it has just enough features to provide you with privacy, nothing else. It lacks a lot of typical mandatory features for this to be a typical browser, such as normal page scrolling and other browser related settings."
122,"5 stars for what you do for users' privacy, but one star for not putting in crash detection code. If a particular site in one tab causes the app to hang and I have to kill the app, having the app *always*, *automatically-with-no-way-to-opt-out* reload all the sites and tabs from the last run *including the problematic site* when I try to start the browser again does not work! So pls: be smart! In response to DDG's question: there is no particular site. After opening a few tabs, it just hangs."
123,"I really want to love this browser but it's soooo slow. It means that I have to then use other browsers that I'm trying to avoid. Also I appreciate the incognito element but I would like to be able to copy and repaste into search bar, but have to always type in. Can there be a setting that allows you to copy/paste, at least during any session where you're continually active? Please help me to get the most out of this app as I really want to make it my main browser"
124,"WARNING THIS APP IS NOT A VPN! This app is only good for searching data on the Duckduckgo site, it offers absolutely NO privacy when visiting other websites and compromises your privacy. This app is utterly useless for searching the web for information. They're latest policies have killed any uniqueness they had. Duckduckgo is just a standard search engine now, one you can visit with any other browser for the same ""privacy"" effect. This app is pointless."
125,"I love it....before the update. I now can not add any bookmarks. So in order to see if it was because I had changed some setting on my phone, I deleted and re-downloaded it. Still can't add bookmarks, and no longer can I have more than one tab open at a time. Not to mention that if i leave the app, weather to switch thru other apps or to close out all the way, it closes out the ONLY TAB I CAN HAVE! Can someone please help me with this issue?"
126,Overall the browser is good at maintaining privacy and blocks trackers but the tab menu is so dam ugly that it sucks! The fire 🔥 button is good concept but doesn't work for everyone! Add some new features like Swipe to next tab And the setting menu is also ugly plz take a look over it!
127,"It's cool and all, but after browsing [REDACTED] it allows any and every popup to block your view and let's links send you to shady fake sites that say you have a virus and there's genuinely and literally no settings to protect yourself. This is by far the most bare bones browsing app you'll ever have, I highly suggest using the website version on another app. Also also, closing the app and reopening it will delete previous site data so the back button is useless as ever."
128,I used to be able to use this app when I highlighted text (in an app that is not a browser) and hit search. DDG would then open the search in my default browser. The recent update removed its ability to accept searches in that way and turned it into its own browser. I guess I have to copy-paste into the browser or just search with the Google app now.   Please restore the search provider feature and make sure it can open in the default browser like before. I don't want a new browser.
129,Resin not giving 5 star: 1.Add to home sreen name not editable 2.Add to home sreen logo always same duckduckgo so not even initial of the webpage sonits vertually useless. 3.Liitle slow. 4.For getting privacy search asking fir another app to install. 5.Browser has auto roration but it can't autorotate the player without using phone. Now reason you gained 2star is it has ad block rest it has 5 very big disadvantage even for mere regular usages so it is bit better than just a search engine app.
130,just about good enough to use but has some usability issues.______ pro: good for privacy. as fast as others.______ cons: no forced zoom option for pages. it's sometimes difficult to scroll down a page without 'accidentally' clicking something. when scrolling down you often get a warp speed movement. if a link opens in a new tab then you click back it doesn't close that window and return you to the original tab. you can't highlight text in Facebook to copy
131,"Hello, I have been using DuckDuckGo for quite a longer time. It has been a nice experience while surfing through internet with privacy been protected as well. There are few things that make this browser outdated: 1. The image files are downloaded in '.bin' format while almost all phone galleries support '.jpeg' or '.jpg' format. This thing is terribly wrong and spoils the taste of internet surfing. 2. Unlike Google Chrome there is no option of downloading the page for offline view."
132,"crashes constantly. tracks location. can't even handle one tab without crashing, let alone multiple tabs. wouldn't doubt if it does track and collect / store activity to function with 99.9% of sites. update: damn thing just stopped working altogether. can't even finish loading one page, especially if you leave to do something else. became useless after update was downloaded. waste."
133,"The app is ok but this is not browser , you can't browse amazon , links dont open in new tab etc. They are trying to mimic Google app . Dont use this app just set duckduckgo search as default search engine in browser ."
134,"Some basic things are missing - can't even share images. Downloaded images don't show in any folder. Extremely irritating browsing behaviour. Often when browsing within a site, clicking a link will open a new tab without obvious notification. When you try to navigate back, the tab just goes blank (surprising you, because you didn't know it opened a new tab) and you have to view all tabs to find the original site."
135,I like your privacy idea but I am uninstalling it for now cos 1. It's  impossibly slow 2. It's like an alpha release with no navigation buttons eg  Back Forwards 3. No tab toolbar meaning it takes 2 clicks to change tabs 4.  On one site I use often articles I click open in new windows rather than  new tabs despite my settings. I'll check you out again in 6 months
136,"It might be fine as a lightweight, privacy focused browser if you want that, but Firefox Focus already serves that function for me. I'd normally just skip giving this a rating, but it has apparently completely replaced the DuckDuckGo search app, which I always loved and used daily. I could just use this as a replacement, which I imagine is the intent, but the DuckDuckGo browser is missing a few features I need, specifically the ""open in browser"" option, and the having the app open on the search line, preventing the need for a pointless extra tap when trying to do a quick search. Disappointing."
137,"Needs work. Clicking on a search bar within a website fails to bring up the keyboard. Better yet, embed a separate dedicated keyboard for use within the browser, so that URLs, search terms, and form entries don't get logged by the default keyboard. That way, one could still use the default keyboard's predictive text within other apps such as SMS, email, etc., without the browsing keyboard capturing sensitive info. Would need a button to switch to the default keyboard for commenting, chats, etc."
138,"I love the privacy, but the restriction defeats the purpose. The main reason why I installed a privacy-based browser was to, and I will shamelessly admit, browse NSFW pages. Now, so far it's been great. But when I search for ""Adult"" content, I can never see NSFW results in the other tabs besides ""All"", like ""Images"" and ""Videos"". Still a big problem as that's where I get most of my material. :/ Please fix this, or at least, show NSFW images and videos properly."
139,"This is FAKE privacy: e.g. will show 15 trackers blocked but when you toggle slider Off, DDG shows 45 trackers. So 30 trackers are still in place! See plenty of ""ads placed by DDG"", as well as popover ads with bogus privacy slider enabled. Several sites report DDG as ""Chrome mobile""!! The majority of these 5 star reviews must be fake or ppl are unaware of the false premises of DDG."
140,"Popcicle stick and glue design. Its very in your face about this extension for the browser thats already a feature, and rating it, so here I am. Popup screens suck, pressing back once just takes you to a blank screen, twice exits the app, and suddenly the search feature in the url bar just gives up. Slow as sin. Lack of history is the only thing this offers in the vein of ""privacy"", unless they dont sell data, or something. Wouldn't know."
141,"Don't like the bottom interface, it ruins the flow having to scroll up to either get bookmarks or burn it to the ground, because keyboard or android main buttons aways obscure it. I liked your earlier builds that had a drop or swipe menu. Lg stylio 5 user. Plus when you open a new session it auto opened the keyboard, so several clicks later and a swipe i get to the bookmark i wanted."
142,"giving it another go hope it doesn't fail after a few days this time unfortunately there's no way to stop it clearing search data meaning each time i open the app i have to search websites TWICE to get there.i prefer to open browsers and have list of sites I've already visited...not start from scratch... its good for blocking ads on YouTube website tho, will ad more stars...maybe? USELESS APP deleted"
143,"it's a good app, easy to use, but the issues I have experienced with it are, it does not save your tabs when you close the app, or it starts playing an old video you already closed down. I have seen it on a few other reviews that when opening a new tab it goes straight to it instead of staying on the home page. One thing the app does that I like a lot is it does not stop playing the video when you turn off the screen, it is so nice!"
144,Just lost all my tabs from months because they put the stupid 🔥 icon on the front which can easily be engaged in your pocket like in my case with no way to backup your browsing session let alone ever being able to export bookmarks. This app is a joke and there is no real thought put into it to become a browser that can be useful daily. Thanks for completing screwing me over. Do not make this your default browser it is not reliable!
145,"really nice, still: Some sites are not well configured, size and place of things for example. When you click to ""open in a new tab"" it shouldnt go to that tab, it should just open. The sound of this browser is really low, . Last but not least it should have an incognito mode wich closes the tabs when you leave and erases the data and a normal mode wich dosent (i know that you can change that on the settings, but there is eighter keep erasing or not erase at all)"
146,"The app was working great overall until Android Pie. while it still works, it's gone a bit wonky. For example, if I open another app, when I come back, the page I had opened is now closed. And when I open the function to show the closed tabs, when I tap on one it doesn't open. another issue is sometimes, 25% of the time, if I hit the back button, which used to return it to the page I just previously left, the entire app closes. there are more but I don't have enough space to explain all here."
147,"I just saw an ad on YouTube as a commercial for DuckDuckGo, normally I skip as soon as allowed, but this ad caught my attention, I absorbed everyword, and then downloaded it, problem with this however is that with all the negatives about FB (I abandoned that over 10 years ago) and Google, I am then directed to Google Playstore to download, because I have to admit I am confused as heck, I can't fathom how privacy is going to be insured, if Google in essence has control of the very app."
148,"Used to love the app but having to reset your settings and viewing preferences every time you open the app is ridiculous and a pointless waste of time. Font size and theme should be saved by default. A dark mode options that extend to sites you visit is also long overdue. Firefox extension ""Dark background light text"" does it well. Not using the duck yuck go app anymore."
149,"Disappointed pretty quickly. I guess I was expecting an ad-free app, so when I got a full-page ad the first time I searched for a website (within 10 minutes of downloading, after going through the Settings), I was surprised. Oh well, buh bye and back to Chrome. At least it doesn't show me, a 62 year old woman with scoliosis, ads for sports equipment."
150,"Love the idea of getting off of one of the big 3 browsers, but DDG lacks  some major functionality that I get from Firefox. To name the big ones: 1.  There's no option to open a web page in an app. If I search for something  and go to the Wiki page, I can't press a button to launch the Wiki app. 2.  As far as I can tell tell there are no extensions, so I can't ad block."
151,"Im gettin the same issue as everyone else thus far. The app is freezing whenever I attempt to use it, and its frustrating to say the least since Im almost constantly lookin stuff up/on my phone browser. Only reason I didnt give it 1 star is the customization you can do through settings, but even that is irritating to try and get to since its on the homepage, not the drop down side bar."
152,"you say you are for privacy but as recent data and information on your product has become available, it shows you are no different than other non secure browsers...too bad, I use to trust you guys so much that I lead lots of other people to install your browser and I sand your praises but ""NO MORE"" enough is enough!!! I would not recommend this browser to anyone else and will make sure I let all the people I recommended you to know that ""YOU ARE NO LONGER A SAFE BROWSER"" I AM UNINSTALLING!!!👎👎"
153,"Edit: Homescreen widget is back (yay), but the app still operates as a browser, not as a search engine per se. Can't see the option to set it to open in my normal browser. Considering there has been an update everyday for a few days this just isn't good enough. Sorry DDG, I gave you the chance, but the app is getting uninstalled."
154,"I use this as my main browser on my phone. It works great, but one thing that annoys the life out of me is videos auto playing. I'm taking away three stars because a browser where its main feature is privacy should have a setting like that turned off by default. There is no way to turn off auto playing videos in this browser. Forget browsing quietly in bed next to someone."
155,"No default desktop browser setting, no popup blocker, popups hijack your page and you can't get out of them without closing the tab and losing your page, no way to turn off notification chimes it seems. Nice idea, love the privacy, but this app has a way to go still."
156,"I use it pretty much always, but it seems they intentionally remain generic quality. duckduckgo was getting better than Google, and then they got worse again. I have a theory. They're either using search algorithm writers that intentionally provide inferior algorithms, or they've got a deal with Google to retain an inferior search quality. There is a better. Google used to be it. If you learned how to put keywords correctly, and you were willing to look through it, you could find anything."
157,"I really wanted to like this browser but when you ""right-click"" a link and select ""open in new tab"" it automatically opens the new tab and I see no way to change this in the settings. Virtually all my browsing of news sites is done by scrolling down the main page for the site and choosing ""open in new tab"" for all the articles that interest me. Then I start opening each tab to read he article. Having each new tab open automatically is a deal breaker and I won't use this browser more."
158,"So much nicer and better thought out than the chrome browser, especially when you open multiple tabs. *UPDATED Review - after an update, my phone woke me up in the middle of the night with a notification from duck duck go to show me a very self congratulatory 'privacy report' of how many cookies it's blocked, ironic from a browser that's about privacy. This rubbish shouldn't be pushed as a notification."
159,"I like this browser for the most part, but recently it has been freezing frequently, hence only two stars. I use it in combination with PIA VPN. [I mention this only because it might be relevant to the browser freezes.] Also, is there a way to disable drag-down refresh? It's really annoying to try to scroll down while typing into a text field, only to refresh instead and have to restart the entire text entry. (TIA)"
160,"I really support duckduckgo app(& search engine)but it still needs a lot of work on small little things.Like when I tap to open a link in a new window it quickly redirects me to the new tab which I don't want and also I don't think that to switch between each tabs I've to tap on that ""+"" button every time it's kinda annoying (maybe something like swiping on the title to switch tabs will be much better? I guess). Thanks"
161,My trial is over before 24hrs and back with google. Duck duck 🦆 go go go right off of my phone. Took absolutely ages to download a single image and a video all day then don't even download. The browser also doesnt let ceratin movie sites open a new tab when they direct you away briefly to an advert. Leaving you on a new page with no way of getting back. Also the browser appears to be giving me generic google results anyhow and the top result is always and ad. It no good for me.
162,"I like this app because I value my privacy but it tends to freeze after I put in a search result for a website. Let me explain. While it's loading a page, sometimes it stops a little more that halfway through the loading process and just Freezes. I can't even use the fire button to clear my data. Hopefully an update will be released to resolve this issue."
163,"No longer works since recent update. I have had it installed on my tablet for over a year without problems but now I either get an error message or pages will not download. I sent a message to Help but never got a reply. Maybe it's my tablet, maybe it's from the latest update, I don't know. I have even uninstalled and reinstalled several times without a fix. It was great while it lasted though."
164,"App (and webpage) used to be great. Recently though, the search results have gotten awful. When I'm shopping, I like to shop. When I'm looking for adjustment or repair procedures for something I've already bought, that is what I want to see. The search results used to reflect this. Now, almost all of the results are, ""buy, buy, buy"". When I'm looking for the procedure to program the key fob for my car, I don't want to see result after result trying to sell me a new car."
165,I support the numerous reviews regarding the search widget. I thought Duckduckgo was supposed to be a Google alternative search engine. Now it's forcing users to use the DDG browser and thus compete with Firefox. Firefox already does a great job being a privacy-focused browser -- they aren't part of the problem like Google. I like the idea of creating a new DDG app for the search widget that allows users to change browsers like the old one. Please consider these requests!
166,"would like to be able to open something to a new tab, but not make the new tab the active tab. I changed my settings to use Google maps, but im still forced to use apple maps. finally I'm actually not so sure I like the fact that it doesn't know my location. makes it a bit more of a challenge to search things - but privacy is the point of this app"
167,Disappointed Avoiding having a screen full of stuff I don't want to see is the reason DuckDuckGo is my default search engine rather than Google. Unfortunately a screen full of stuff I don't want to see is precisely what the Duck Duck Go app home screen delivered after installating it. Maybe there's a way to turn the ballast off and just have the search bar like on the web but I couldn't be bothered to look and instead just made DDG my default internet home page. I was expecting more from DDG but not in this way!
168,"I really want to give it 5 stars but........ I love the DuckDuckGo website, it beats every other search engine including Google hands down and I use it as my homepage and search engine in a different browser. However I downloaded the app and then uninstalled it after 1 minute. I was disappointed to find that the app is nothing like as customisable as the standard webpage. No options for changing themes, privacy, appearance etc. Sorry DuckDuckGo but until these options are added to the app, I'll stick with the web version."
169,- Clear tabs and data on exit doesn't work. You have to click the fire thing manually. If you exit the app and open it again the last page you were on reopens. - Changing the app icon breaks the app. Nothing happens when you click the icon so there's no way to open the app unless you uninstall and reinstall it. Edit: restarting phone fixes this issue
170,"I will continue to use the duckduckgo search engine solely because it isn't Google, but I am actively searching for a replacement. Duckduckgo doesn't care about its users or their experience, they ask for feedback and then completely ignore it, and they frequently make arbitrary UI changes without reason except for change. Every time you submit feedback they say ""thanks, it really helps!"" but I'm 99% sure their feedback inbox goes right to the trash. Advice: stop changing the UI every month."
171,"Not able to use this app with the ""swipe up"" gesture anymore, not able to view pages in default browser anymore, not able to find good reasons to use it anymore. I used to like it, but I no longer have any reason to keep it on my phone.  **Reply** For sure I'll come back to see the changes.  As soon as those things are back, the app will return on my phone immediately.  An other - non-essential, though - feature that I was sad to loose was the ability to move the app to SD card.  Great to see the devs proactive with the public!"
172,"great service bad app, love ddg and will continue to use them as long as they stay private, but this app always crashes when loading a previous page or old tabs. It may be this horrible phone though but a lightweight app like this shouldn't be crashing whenever I load a small uncomplicated website. Thanks ddg for all you do."
173,"Clean UI, and fast. Main complaint is results are sometimes completely off base. I will search something on web results, and then click on images and the results barely match up. (Safe search is off) Tested against chrome and Bing and they provide accurate results. Thought ddg used their results but it could be how they parse the data"
174,"*WHY NO BOOKMARKS FOLDERS?* Very hard to use as main browser, hence i often forget to use it for months or years. It's because I always go to same 10 websites and its impossible to have some nice quick favorite tabs/bookmarks. Also i want to open a new tab to read later yet it automatically takes me to the new tab. It's either 0 stars or 5 stars but ill opt for 2. It has potential to be best browser due to privacy tech, but its not user friendly so its quite useless, hence not used much at all"
175,"The browser itself is great and easy to use. I've even switched to DuckDuckGo for my desktop search needs. It took a couple of weeks for me to realise why Google is the best. They have top notch SEO (search engine optimisation), and in this browser I rarely found what I was looking for through just typing it in the search bar. I had to go through Google. It would be nice if this browser had the option to set a default search engine but I see how that is unlikely."
176,"Not useful, in google it doesn't matter if they're tracking what your searching for 3 reasons, (1) because they track you so that if your searching up how to get, say guns illegally online and you get found out that they can prove that you were doing illegal activity, (2) you can turn off targeted ads so that it just shows random ads, and (3) targeted ads are to help them make money, in the ad for this it said that they brainwash you, but that's just a stupid obviously not true business idea."
177,Was unable to disable JavaScript and whitelist on a per-site basis. The dark theme was really nice... Until i tried visiting a site and noticed that while loading the entire screen is white (have yet to find a browser that does not do this sillyness :/ )
178,"I like it, but why can't we swipe away tabs from the list rather than hitting the X icon in the corner? It is also a confusing user experience when hitting the back button results in the webpage closing rather than going back to the last app that caused the browser to initially open."
179,"When viewing full images, there is a slide delay. That's pretty annoying. Also, please remove the wasted space around images for practical reasons. Some of us don't need ""fancy"" but we need something that lets us view as many images on the screen as possible. One last complaint, google chrome adds more relevant images below the current selected image, this is also an important feature. I wanted to move to a different browser and this is the best one that I could find - but it still is lacking."
180,Edit.It used to be the absolute best browser. But the last few months its been some really annoying problem. When i open a new tab to look at a recipe or a picture or anything and then i close the tab and want to go back to the page i had open but its all white stays so for several minutes and sometimes it goes back to the page but most times it either go back to start of this app or it goes back to my home screen. Its extremely annoying especially when there isn't history and open tab that way
181,"Nice idea with he privacy securing browser, but there are a lot of issues. First, on some websites its not possible to watch videos in full screen, second, sometimes files are not downloaded properly, so they won't open, and third, sometimes wedsides are not displayed in mobile view, though they have a mobile page."
182,"Would rate much higher, but THIS is a biggie for a ""Privacy"" Browser. I change settings to Automatically Clear Tabs and Data...when exiting app. Close and reopen app and voila! There's the tabs and data from my last session. Am I missing something here?"
183,"+200mb & increasing not sure why no tab opened. Fortunately, there is an option to clear data within the app. Top privacy. Some basic gestures not working like swiping down to update the page, right left to move from the page ."
184,"I am so very frustrated with this new version that I've stopped using it for most things. And that frustrated me even more. Why is this upgrade better than the  last version? It's not apparent that it offers more.   The DuckDuckGo help site for Android users hasn't been updated in some parts and lacks a simple how-to use page, with examples, beyond their features highlights pages.  I get the privacy bit, yada yada yada -- but the older version was much more full featured. DuckDuckGo convince me otherwise.  Why is there no share function anymore? I've searched at the DuckDuckGo website (and in desperation Googled it) for an answer and nothing pops. I don't use Duckduckgo exclusively now because I want to share a page to email or send to Pocket.   PS, I really miss the curated articles, it made for a nice break in my day. And no, going to the Twitter link to follow doesn't help my privacy."
185,"It's ok but for some reason when I try to download an image it won't download no matter what. I just get a notification saying "" download unsuccessful"". When I look at the permissions for this app it shows it's allowed to look at and modify USB storage. Perhaps this means it's not able to utilize internal storage? Either way this is terrible and messing around with settings has gotten me nowhere."
186,Has been crashing on average once a day. Does not auto clear tabs and data even though i have it set to do that. Have sent several freedbacks but still having same issues. Will probably end up uninstalling it. My feedbacks have been ignored. I uninstalled it. The Brave App is working great for me.
187,"When I open youtube in this browser, it defaults to chinese and since I don't read mandarin I have no idea what to click to change the site to english. I am not in China or Taiwan, I am in Malaysia so why does it force load chinese version of popular sites?? This renders the app useless to me."
188,"""New Tab"" doesn't work on my tablet. Other browsers that have a New Tab option actually open a new browser tab. DDG just clears previous data and goes to new site. There is never more than one tab open. If a new tab can't be opened, then please remove that from the Options. Samsung Galaxy Tab A 10.1, 2019 version)"
189,"Still no text only mode/simple mode and the bottom tool bar cant be reverted back to the traditional layout.... I mean the mapping is just not logical. After the update it kept lagging when scrolling(frequently lags). Re-installed this for the 4th time now and lagging persists, did a reboot too and cleared data/storage and cache lot of times It's not my phone's problem cause brave browser doesn't lag and that browser requires more juice to run. *Update: UI and UX sucks now. Using Via now"
190,Great for privacy. If more than one tab is opened switching between them causes other tabs to go blank. Pages don't resize to screen. Many sites slow loading. Cannot organize bookmarks.
191,"I would really like to know what ""better measuring engagement"" means. It sounds a lot like tracking, and with the absence of any explanation or opt-out in settings, I'm surprised at the lack of transparency here. In fact, most updates lately bring fewer settings, less clarity, and less functionality. I never use this app anymore because it's no longer even remotely recognizable from its original incarnation."
192,"Although this version is a deliberate shift to simplify, for myself and presumably other existing users, it seems more of a downgrade.   This was my primary app for using Tor and offered a real alternative to the tor browser with a good level of customisability.  Now without tor functionality and no options regarding cookies, scripts, etc; the app has moved out of a niche and into an already crowded space without doing anything to differentiate itself from Firefox Focus, Ghostery and other privacy browsers. Barring the pretty UI of course... and the wee biddy picture of a fire for burning away your tracks..."
193,"A few times when i looked something up i dont get as many top options as i have on on google, and i sometimes dont get the best sites to go into ""Drudge report"", for example ....which take time hunting it up...i find a few little problems...but i want to keep using Duckduckgo ....and use it as my main search engine, when you get a few little bugs ironed out....sure wish you could have your own social network to strongly compete with facebook. Many (including myself) have little to no faith in fb."
194,"Love the concept of a privacy-focused browser, but two things keep me from  ditching Chrome in favor of this one: (1) I don't like that my keyboard  automatically appears when I open the app (I usually want to work from my  bookmarks); (2) Lack of home button/ability to set a home page."
195,"Please, instead of forcing this compromised browsing experience, simply make it a search engine, with an alternative widget to that of the scroogle search bar. That way, it shows results in it and when I tap a link, it just opens in my favorite and most feature packed web browser; Samsung Internet. I just want quick access to the DuckDuckGo search engine via a widget on my home screen, not for it to compromise my browsing experience. Better yet, make a separate app for that. Thanks."
196,"Unfortunately had to delete. To many little issues that become annoying using this browser. First when you are on a web page and go to navigate to another via url bar it will just hang. Forcing you to restart program. Secondly it will not download pdf files at all. I tried uninstalling, re installing, clearing cache etc. Every other browser works except this one."
197,"A very good light, fast, secure browser. Automatically turns on the incognito mode of SwiftKey. I hope it stays as minimalistic as it is. There are two areas that need improvement: - Bookmarks UI - needs to be improved. Please provide option for sorting and add bookmark folders. - When screen brightness changes due to ambient light conditions, the display turns off, while YouTube video is playing."
198,"when opening some link DDG shows up blank. is only until i return to previous page then hit the link again and then I'm sent to the site. very frustrating s9 Update: 5/2020 isn't auto clearing on ""app exit"". Adjusted settings. I have to manually hit the flame icon to clear."
199,A promising browser but needs more configuration options such as setting start page and organizing bookmarks. Another feature that would be useful is the ability to clear site data for a specific site or the currently open site.
200,"Good, but could be better, some things don't load on certain sites, there not dodgy sites either. Some sites won't load at all, I.e my girlfriends NHS site for blu light card won't work on duck duck go so she has to use google. When I click on the search bar on some sites my keyboard won't pop up to type, I have to exit, and reopen duck duck go, this never happens on Google, but I don't want to use the corrupt google so I'll pit up with these little niggles. 5 stars if you can sort these out."
201,"Handicapped by ""news"" feed I love the search engine, but this app wastes time and bandwidth loading irrelevant ""headlines"" and pictures in some weird feed instead of just loading the search bar and searching.  Merely an annoyance when I've got 4G, but I live in a rural area and on Edge the search engine is unusable.  Firefox will let you use DuckDuckGo as the default search engine, and there's a ""Firefox search""  option for the swipe-up-from-the-home-button search feature, which is what I do now."
202,"While it is a good browser and definitely faster than chrome, I feel like it's severely lacking features. For example, it lets you completely delete your history, but there's not even an option to only delete the history from one tab. It doesn't even let you properly download images. If you want a secure browser that doesn't spy on you, download Firefox and set DuckDuckGo as your search engine, it's a much better and fully-featured experience."
203,Good on Apple terrable on Android. Settings really need polishing for Android/Samsung devices. There's no direct link to bookmarks forcing us to select the tab to the side just to get to bookmarks & to download images we gotta view file adding more click & not crazy about having to hold the image down to bring up the download prompt. Doing things with fewer clicks should be a priority for the user interface to make it better.
204,"I opened the app this morning and it was on Amazon. This would not normally be seen as a problem, however, I had not been on Amazon in days and the last time I used the app I cleared the history. You cannot convince me that they are not keeping tabs on your browsing history just like Google. This is an additional comment and the reason I have now uninstalled the app. Did a search on Google then changed to DDG, the Google search page came up with header and all when I opened the app. Not good."
205,"Missing an option to use the default browser rather than the built-in one. Searching and browsing are separate activities. That would also utilize available apps (like Wikipedia) rather than a browser. I made this simple suggestion a long time ago, but nothing happened. I guess if it was going to happen, it would have by now. It boggles the mind to have this app be much less useful than it could be. Downgrading to 1 star for continued ignorance of such a basic feature."
206,"This app closes every page that I open after I hit the back button and after I minimize to switch to a different task with no way to recover the page. It takes me to the blank home screen with the logo in the center then displays a blacked out tab where the page used to be when I open the tabs button. EXTREMELY frustrating. Ive lost too many references for my research due to this. I will not be using this app anymore, as its cost me more time and effort than contributing towards productivity."
207,"Hey, NO matter how much privacy you give its the ease of use that always wins........ i cannot navigate forward and backward through the web pages ........by swiping frwd & backward & also cannot switch between multiple tabs through swiping gestures on url tab....... The microsoft edge browser has these abilities, which is made of the same chromium and similar UI as this app. Please do include them in the next update. Please...!!!"
208,"I really liked this browser--no stupid ads, no tracking, more private, etc. It was my default browser. Now I try to get on the same websites I always get on on the browser, and it freezes at the 2/3 loading point & has to be closed because nothing will work. I've deleted it and redownloaded it and it still won't work. Please fix. I don't want to use another browser app."
209,Nice and fast but needs a way to set a home site. Default site is the duckduckgo search bar unless you have went to another we site then it becomes that latest website visited. Has add web site to home setting but nothing happens. Needs a site refresh button. Needs to be able to organize bookmarks in folders.
210,"Devs, please fix this, when I type in a search bar on YouTube, or any other site that has a search bar, my key typing app works once, but then after the second time, when I click the search bar, my typing app does not show and it's only when I use duck duck go. Google never has this problem as my keyboard on my phone always works, it stops working when using ur browser, please fix that urgently. I always have to close ur browser and then re open it for my typing app to work, SwiftKey app."
211,"It was nice at first. But I started noticing that if I switched to a different app for longer than a minute or so, it would refresh. Which is quite annoying. And pushing the back button was a gamble whether you would actually get the previous page, or you would get a new tab. when I was on other apps and would click to open the link in this browser, it would write over tabs that I had open, meaning that I would no longer be able to access this tabs. This browser became more of a pain to use,and its cons outweigh the pros. I deleted it after only a few days, because I was tred of it."
212,"Used to be a great simple Search widget. I see the usefulness of the Privacy browser, however I would really like the option to just use the Search widget with my own browser or a light version of the app that doesn't include the integrated browser."
213,"Missing core functions of a browser:  No share. No find find in page. No capacity to save images. No selection of text for clipboard. No open-with function. No import/export of bookmarks.  I don't care how private it is, if it fails as a browser, it fails."
214,"I would like to use this app. But user experience problems make it unusable for me. When using the back button, instead of taking me back to the previous page. It takes me back to the Duck Duck Go search page and I have to start all over. This makes the app a no go. In addition the keyboard it forces me to use is awkward, the space bar is way too narrow and causes typing errors which uses more of my time. The bottom line is the app wastes too much of my time with UX problems. Fix these issue's and I'm in!"
215,"Has potential. They should capitalize on the 'tap to forget' feature. There are several issues. No tab deletion confirmation, no tab/download history, no pull to refresh, no customization, or settings options really. It matters. When double tapping a word it highlights the whole paragraph. This is incredibly annoying. When I go on Reddit it asks me if I want to open the app. When I press it takes me to the Playstore page. Isnt transparent w/ privacy policy If not fixed soon, may go back to Chrome"
216,"Editing my former 5-star rating I initially wrote after 4 months of use. It's been a few more months and I now constantly go back to google chrome, though I don't want to. The ONLY reason I tend to use chrome is because swipe texting + auto complete are unusable in DuckDuckGo's search bar. In Chrome, spaces are auto inserted after words, but that doesn't happen in this app, making searching very hard. If this is fixed, I believe I can finally quit google, and will restore my 5/5 review."
217,"I'm a fan of the service this app provides: private internet browsing. However, this browser seems to lack basic things such as the ability to change your download location, or opening image-based links in a new tab. Sometimes saving images simply doesn't work. I'm confident these flaws will be fixed in later patches, but for now the app is only good, and not great. Better than Chrome though."
218,"No website loads. Private internet captive portal doesn't load either. Useless. Wasted 15 minutes looking at the browser trying to load various pages, even Google, in vain."
219,"4.22.20. New update is no help. Here's a work around for the app's incompetence: When a web page hangs up (not if, when...) close all tabs and exit the browser. Restart. ...and in the 10 or 20 minutes since the first review DDG has crashed once, required a restart, and then took 30-60 seconds to load a simple web page. On my Samsung S10. You're headed quickly to a one star review and an uninstall, ducky. Really fast, as in about 24 hours if that can even be tolerated. Horrible browser."
220,"I APPRECIATE the privacy of this app but the search ability needs work... !! I have read about plenty of confusion about MISSING DOWNLOADS. If you open your file manager you SHOJLD find a folder named ""Pictures"", you should find your downloaded images in it."
221,Latest version search from the address bar gives a blank page. Workaround is to touch the A icon top left the back arrow. Great private browser but really needs forced page zoom option.
222,The latest update ruined it. Websites keep getting stuck or load only partially. Clicking the 🔥 button does nothing and hangs the browser into a blank screen. I have to use the Android app switcher key or long press the home button to come out. Only restarting the phone fixes this after it happens. Please fix it.
223,"I love the app, but I'm tired of having to constantly re-download it because after a certain amount of searches (not many at all) all the rest will just show up as ""Webpage not available"" and it will have a bunch of other stuff, and the only way to fix this that I've found is un-installing it and installing it back. I've pretty much just stopped using it because of this, it is VERY annoying. I like the service, but not the glitch."
224,This app is a pain. Doesn't need to run at boot!!! Still behaving erratically. Completely crashed and burned. Data clearing didn't fix it. No solutions or feedback from the guys in Malvern... thanx Uninstalled this buggy junk...
225,"major flaw. I got this browser hoping that I would not be tracked by anyone because I got tired of Google always tracking what I do. third-party apps buy my data and try to manipulate me into giving them money (eg through ads) anytime a tab is left open for longer than ten minutes, automatically I'm taken to a Google custom search engine. I know this is just another tactic to track me (browser hijacker) and it's not fair because this is a privacy app. Duck duck go was my default browser too"
226,I like this browser but I probably won't continue to use it because even when it is set as default browser I can't open links from other apps with it. Android only gives me chrome and Firefox as my options. Would definitely be my default if this got solved. Edit* I found out it is only the YouTube app that I can't open links on.
227,"I've read an article in this browser and then I switched to crome and searched for answers for some gaming problems and clicked on quora and Suddenly I noticed that the bottom half of my screen is covered with the same article i read on duckduckGo a few minutes ago(2mins). And the article was about do not track setting, which was suggested by duckduckGo. Sooo creepy 😖. And I don't know y sme apps showing a ""search duckduckGo"" option on long pressing a word(I haven't granted any permission).opp"
228,"Works great to keep you browser clear of extra tabs.Allows to save favorites,but dosen't allow you to organize or category. Update version had some bugs, remembering settings like dark screen when closing out tab.You still have to go to setting to clear cach files though,so when it supposed to claim that it dosen't leave a trace when you close out....It does!!! The history clears when closing.If anyone used google remembers , clearing your typed history is a pain in the arse."
229,"When you search for something, it pulls up a bunch of other sites that has nothing to do with what your searching for....I want to see pics, options, and other links that I can click on. You don't want us to use Google because of privacy issues so you make your browser sound like a good option. Well here is an idea, make it more like Google with options, pics, etc and we would stray away from Google!"
230,Im afraid its duckduckGone. You havent read or replied to peoples feedback on the problems we are having. Your app is now deemed unsafe to use and unreliable to use. So its duckduckgone for me. Uninstalling app. I gave it a chance and a second chance. You obviously not that bothered.
231,Poor app Keeps crashing. Can't edit safe mode always comes back to the main page. Should have safe mode in settings on home screen. Also has some issues when using with or web. The site itself is very good the app.... Sort it out guys
232,"Lacking quality It will let you search & finds results more relevant than other search engines or browsers. Can't find current history. It lists some but not all. While trying to fill in forms/log in to a site, copy/paste, it may paste only part of copy or it may go back a page or do something random. Pretty good for simple searches. Still needs improvement before setting as default browser."
233,"A couple of things that I don't like.. when I click a link a new tab opens which is fine but when I'm done with said tab and press back it minimises the app. Instead you have to close the tab and then choose your previous one. Can pressing back just take you to the last tab?? Secondly, I'm in the UK and search results are never local. Presumably US related results. Other than that it's all OK."
234,"The recent update make this browser become worse, font size become smaller and if you also open another few tabs, some of them have normal size font. Often happen recently, the result from search become blank page and only visible if you reselect the tab and this problem never happen in 2 previous version. Old problem is still there, if you ""add"" multiple tabs and lets say you go to the address 1 by 1 from your bookmark, any not-connected yet tab will be deleted or overwrited by the current tab"
235,"Duck Duck Go is becoming like every other browser. They treat users like idiots and tell them nothing about what they are actually publishing. And I quote ""Bug fixes and other improvements"", so you don't need to know details just trust us! The general attitude today."
236,"The app needs some work. When I'm on Facebook, videos tend to not display properly or just go all crazy and give me a black flickering screen until I scroll past the video. The ability to go to a previous page definitely needs to be worked on. When I close the app or open a new link in duckduckgo, I cannot go to the previous page in the other open windows/tabs on Android. Other than this, app seems to work well."
237,"Feeling really frustrated using this browser on my new Chromebook (I used DDG on my old Win10 system without a problem). Among other things, it seems to completely lack the right-click context menu e.g. I use 'open in new tab' extensively, and I'm really missing it. FWIW, Chrome on this new Chromebook does have the context menu."
238,"I love the DuckDuckGo search engine but how on earth can the browser have no ""back"" button/arrow to return to a previous page????? And how is nobody else annoyed by this or complaining about it??? I thought I even saw a couple reviews mention the back button, but WHERE IS IT? Also, no tabs? Each new website has to be in one of these tiles? Am I just having a very different experience than everyone else for some reason?! I'm truly puzzled. If I can't find any answers I'm switching browsers."
239,"start update Jan 4 2019 updated from one to 3 stars because it finally deletes persistent ""ever cookies"". Would have rated even higher but it doesn't clear them automatically when the app is closed. end update Jan 4 2019 This apps built-in browser fails to delete persistent cookies even after ""clearing cookies"" & restarting. See ""samy.pl/evercookie"" to test for yourself. I did find that the ""inbrowser"" app passes the evercookie test without having to ""clear cookies""."
240,"Not many features. Apparently all it does is delete cookies automatically, on app start or after a configurable period of inactivity. Tabs work but not as comfortable as in chrome. No control over Javascript sources. URL bar doesn't remember stuff which is a bit silly; bookmarks are an awkward workaround for this. Startpage is not among the default search engines, why not? Otherwise solid and bug free performance."
241,It's OK if you don't need to go back in history to the previous page after doing something else. When you come back to the browser and try to go back it takes you to an empty search page as if you just opened a new tab regardless of how many pages you went through. If this gets fixed I'll bump it up to 5.
242,"Where is the option to show download progress? This app is not user friendly. Switching between the tabs and reloading the page is a pain in the ass and frustrating. Page loading speed is good. The only reason I use this app is, it provides private browsing. So 3 stars!"
243,"New version is a regression Before the overhaul I could long press on any link and open it in a new browser window. Now I can't, I have to open the current page in a browser and then long press the link. Sometimes the search box stops taking keyboard input, so what I type just never goes anywhere. Tapping the input box fixes it, but it's annoying to lose my input."
244,"Where's my forward button? I love the idea of not having filtered options when browsing the Internet, but I don't think I should have to suffer for it. My phone has its own back button,  which is nice when navigating,  but if I wanted to go back to an article that I was reading before, I have to go through a lot of trouble before I can find it again because their us neither a forward button,  nor a full history of what sites I've gone to. I don't have the ability to open multiple pages at once either. Defiantly needs some work."
245,"Previously a 5 star app. They have recently changed the view of your open tabs to show as tiles. This is awful for two reasons 1) the thumbnails take more data to load and often load incorrectly, esp when scrolling through many open tabs (ie thumbnails incorrectly reappear for multiple tabs) 2) the tab name has much fewer characters. I use the tabs feature to open interesting articles during the week which I read on the weekend. Now I can't tell the tabs apart anymore due to the char limit."
246,I missed following features: 👉🏼 Encrypted cloud sync of bookmarks and passwords. 👉🏼 Passwords & Bookmarks export and import. 👉🏼 Minimalistic personalized news feed. 👉🏼 Bottom navigation toolbar (access of bookmarks from toolbar button). ♥️I like the automatically clear tabs and data options.
247,"The app is ok. Here are the issues I've noticed recently: 1) The keyboard doesn't always appear when I want to type in a text box. Nothing I do will fix for that particular text box, but the next box I tap after that works no problem. 2) When I search for any location, it shows the map and it says Google Maps in the bottom right of the search screen, but the actual map itself is Apple Maps. Doesn't give me confidence in this browser. Not yet, anyway."
248,until it comes with an add blocker and redirect blocker it's just not really usable on many sites. Many sites I visit redirect to other pages with adds or give many virus popups and it's impossible to stay on the actual site I wanted to as a new page loads and then I can't even go back so the only option is to close the tab. There seems to be no way to block adds and redirects using this browser. But on the PC I can go on the same sites with all the adds and redirects blocked.
249,"I really love this app and use it to look up pretty much anything. Lately, however, whenever I look something up and I hit the go back button, it goes straight to the start page, instead of the previous one. I was able to counteract it at first by clearing all data, but even that doesn't work anymore. I find this new development to be very user-unfriendly and I'm hoping that this will be fixed soon. Until then, however, I cannot give a higher rating."
250,"First notes for this browser, while scrolling and header moving(hiding and appearing) , page scroll speed changes for a sec. This is so annoying and there are lots of browsers out there which do the same. -There isn't any option to opt out from private browsing. That's also strange. -No fast swipe between tabs. -Downloads are failing(ones with hot stream) - No gesture support for fast refresh - While swiping images placed horizontally, page doesn't lock vertically, and that's annoying."
251,"Everbody should visit: ( BrowserGood. Com ) to install the best browser app. It's block ads and faster. Duck Duck Go works well on mobile, and has helped me get to the results and websites I need to without unnecessary following advertisements, like on Google. However, it only gains 4 stars from me because of how my search results are presented to me using their search engine"
252,"Am going to uninstall this App.... Latest update purportedly only added a light theme according to the App store details... What they didn't say was that it also added a HUGE number of ads... A home page with a full page add, when going to settings many continuous full page ads that I couldn't get past , and at that point I stopped using DDGPB....money is important to everyone but the way this was updated and the persistence of the huge ads is not fair."
253,"I've used DDG for years and been happy with it, however I am not happy with the new boxes for the different tabs open. Before, 50 wider bars for the tabs I could read what each tab was. Now it's a little box but isn't big enough to read the name and most tabs don't have a picture anyway. Makes it really hard to tell which tab is which. I'm a switch to a different product."
254,"The stories can be left out for me, it feels more like a lifestyle blog than a search engine. It would be nice to have shortcuts implemented for use with nova launcher. Google-like functionality (like relevant info directly on top of the page) is useful, but I guess I'll get used to it. Other than that: very sleek design and works well. There is not much difference between just using DDG on the browser though. I feel like the app is missing out on some functionality."
255,I like that there's no history. Sometimes the search results aren't as abundant as Chrome. After a recent update the tabs are in a grid format with no option to switch back to the previous scrolling page. I don't like the grid format and neither does anyone else I've talked to that users this browser. After reading other reviews I'm questioning if this in fact as private as they claim. Another thing I noticed is not once has the dev responded to anyone's comments. Not so good
256,"I submitted a previous review, which DDG replied to, but for some reason I can't reply to it.  Yes, I got the update, and yes it works. However, it still does not allow the user to choose the browser to use.  The DDG browser may very well be a good browser, but it should be an option, not mandatory. My recommendation : release the search widget and the browser separately. Advertise and promote the browser, absolutely. But to force it like this means disturbing some people's habits and workflow. I think a gradual introduction would be better than the approach being used here.  Thanks for following up, regardless."
257,"I have an LG K51 phone. When I completely shut down phone & restart, the app icon & shortcuts saved to my home screen, disappear. The app is still in the drawer, but not on the home screen. Shortcuts are gone for good. Bookmarks within app remain. EDIT: In settings, I'd chosen the purple icon. When reset to the standard red icon, the app icon, and home screen shortcuts remain after restart. I tested a few times. If purple, home screen app icon & shortcut disappear. Did not check other colors."
258,"Basically quite a nice browser, with some good features to protect one's privacy. However: * The concept of feedback categories as (positive / negative) and the practice to avoid negative feedback on the playstore by only redirecting positive feedback there are very dishonest * for some websites it might necessary to permanently store cookies / web storage /etc., e.g. to stay logged in. It would be great, if websites could be excluded from reset * A password manager would be nice"
259,"Ok, this fiasco is improving at least, widget is back, but still using old version until i can open pages from this browser in other browsers again. No idea why that was removed but ill add more stars when it's put back. Until then, old app version is better, and Firefox Focus continues to impress......"
260,"It was a great browser but now I can't, you know, BROWSE with it anymore. Search function is crippled by formatting errors that prevent input from being an option, and moving a map to search a new area just zooms back to the previous area. Not functional for web searches. I'm uninstalling this one now. I loved the mission but this isn't a path for me. I need a search engine I can functionally enter requests into."
261,"I love the privacy but I think im missing something. Hitting the back button on my phone usually goes back to the last page i was on, but sometimes it just closes the app completely, when i open the app back up its back to the home page and I cant find a way to get back to the last page i was on."
262,"Mildly annoying that when you start to type a URL, it doesn't autocomplete from your bookmarks. This is the way I usually get to my favourite sites in other browsers. An alternative would be having quick links/bookmarks displayed when you open a new tab."
263,The more i use duckduckgo the more i think....is it necessary? I get their angle but as someone who doesnt put alot of personal info on the net i dont need it. I personally like it if a service knows what i like so that i can see relevant stuff. A lot of online store links show up in the search on top. Their integration with video links is old fashioned. Kind of funny since their browser seems to be based on chromium. So take from google to exploit google. They are pulling an amazon here. It is good browser to use to test web dev on privacy practices. Other than that i think its more of a tool for paranoia victims. Its hot now cuz of all social buzz in the news
264,"Great free browser, until the latest update. Now it takes so long to load a page (any page) that they time out 50% of the time, or only manage to load a text version (it feels so 2002!). Struggling with it now and thinking of reverting back to Firefox. Also bookmarks - make them sortable!!!! Dropping the new links on the bottom of the list just deters you from having many as searching for the one you want from a long random list is painful! at the very least go alphabetical!!"
265,"Disappointing updates; the app was gutted. Noticeably missing are the recent search listing, an ""open in browser"" option, and a home button. I want these persistence features back. The update has increased the wear on my mechanical home-screen button, which is not ideal."
266,"Wow it's really featureless. You cannot change any settings, there is nothing to change! It's their way or the highway, very smug Apple Inc attitude. I want to import bookmarks, choose if my history is cleared or not, find in page - - - really basic features every browser has these days are missing in this browser. Do not bother. The developers don't listen to my last two complaint reviews, they don't give af."
267,"I have no major concern with the app... except for the frustration of searching for images. Constantly having to tell the search engine to give me more images and if I click a picture, then back out of the picture, it takes me back to the web section and I have to start the entire process all over.... very annoying"
268,"I would rate this browser higher, but it lack some essential basics which prevents me from using this as my main (or only) browser. It needs an ""accessibility"" section in settings where we could adjust the font/display size, it needs a homepage or ""speed dial"" where we can quickly access our most used/visited bookmarks/websites, and it needs the feature to hide the status bar, an absolute must for all phones with amoled screens."
269,The fire button does not delete all browsing data. Visited urls can easily be viewed in the database files of the app after deletion.
270,"I use image search frequently and images only show about 25% of the time, so while i appreciate the anonymity of the app it isn't reliable enough for me to continue using at this time."
271,I loved the privacy policy of this app and it's Blockage of google crawlers all around also it is very profound. But the app lacks when sites that are redirected are blocked and return us to homepage with blank text and previous text is gone.videos in YouTube aren't resolution wise friendly as it is has compatibility issues.but google crawlers are not completely blocked away they can still trace us as location is mentioned below the web page.
272,"Duckduckgo is good in terms of blocking the trackers and is privacy control actions, but its not an completely well equipped app, no popup blocker, no advance setting menu, no add-on, not much of a powerfull downloader, inbuilt translator, scripts, network statistics, less personalization but It all comes down to whether you prefer privacy or personalization."
273,Allow this app to be moved to SD card for android 7 nougat users. I would like Norton to protect this browser. I dont feel very comfortable searching as no indication if sites are safe to go to. Otherwise appreciate your privacy motivated app.
274,"Best Browser for all Error. Video orientation problem, screen off during video streaming problem, keyboard not opening problem while searching in youtube, copy and paste problem Totally this app is full of problem... Uninstalled this garbage."
275,"Can't see the bottom menu bar which means I can't access the back button, can't access bookmarks or multiple tabs. All I can see is the search bar from the top."
276,"I am curious. How do you fund yourselves without ads? Do you sell people's data or have you another source of income for this app's development? I know my questions sound critical, but I am genuinely interested to know where your financial support comes from. In the past, I have encountered numerous which claim 'to be secure' but then I have eventually found out that they have been supported by somewhat clandestine means. Forgive me for sounding sceptical but I would like to know"
277,I find that many of the results I expect don't come up for me so I'm forced to use another search engine. I hate that this happens because I really want to use this pne exclusively.
278,"It doesn't work sometimes, randomly. Search for some page, progress bar is moving, nothing happens. Check the same page in chrome - all is ok. Go back to duckduck page not opening. So this something with duck search. It hangs for no reason. You have to fix that."
279,"if i search something on this browser using their own engine, my Instagram gets flooded with related advertisments. About privacy, this browser doesn't provide any privacy, our data is tracked and used as much as Chrome does. dont get wrong idea by reading the app name."
280,"Very Fast Browser. Easy to delete all cookies, cache and history. I do miss ad blocker add ons. And the biggest problem is the search results for the built in search engine are still sub par to google. Otherwise this would be a 5 star app easy. 3/2019 update after several months of use its come time I delete duck duck go in favor of firefox. Its missing too many things. Undo closed tab is brutal not to have and im missing ad blocker dearly. Once these are added I would be team duck duck go"
281,"this would be a 5 star app , if only it was more like cm browser? like downloading videos with a button and when watching videos online you can make it full screen they turn to the side insted of me going into phone settings to rotate phone and turn volume up by sliding up n down the screen!!! till then this app will only be a 2 Star APP. iv used cm browser last 5 years over Google and chrome browser every time and looking for a change but other browsers just dont match up"
282,"Great for privacy, bad for battery life. It wastes a lot of power. Did a power scan of my phone, added 4 addl hrs of battery life when I shut it off. Now it won't let me return to prior pages.I used to love this search engine, becoming too cumbersome to deal with, had to uninstall. Also, why do you need access to my private files? All I continually see on Google apps--including this app--are ""bug fixes"" without any explanations. Bad for privacy. Sorry. Uninstalled"
283,"Very Limited Functionality Sadly,  Google items such as you tube links fail to open in YouTube App. It tries opening it and fails w option of using basic video player which cannot play you tube links.  There is also an absence of shrink to fit or zoom to fit text wrapping in read mode thus making it useless as a reader on a mobile phone. Lack of settings options. Needs a tad bit of work."
284,"Why WON'T you let pe😡ple manage their own bookmarks⁉️ Give us swipe controls for faster tab page management, ⤴️File/Folder Creation, Importing & Exporting.▪️↩️Bookmarking, Renaming, & Ordering.▪️↪️Deleting. Tiles view should not be the only display choice!▪️ and that back button is f🤬d."
285,"There are certain pages/YT videos that seem to infere with this browser and wouldn't allow me to view them. There are times that this browser doesn't directly answer my queries, and sometimes give me irrelevant results. I seem to be able to search anything thru its search engine, but after using this for a while, there was a certain website that is blocked in this browser and would not let me view it."
286,"Edit: actually this makes the app so hard to use fpr me that I thonk most people experiencing thia issue will switch to another browser. I'll keep it short. I like the app alot and use it as standart browser, I'm just here to report a minor but very annoying problem. Going back a page often doesnt work. Ive waited for several minutes vut nothing happens in each of those instances. If I klick back several times in a row nothing happens either. If I click many times it will just go back to the the standart appearance of a new tab. It doesnt matter wether I use the back button of my phone or that of the duckduckgo browser. Sadly this issue occurs many times during browsing without any apparent pattern. It doesnt happen for any other browsers im using. Im using the browser app of duckduckgo for android, not an extension for other browsers. My phone is a fairphone 2, my OS is fairphone OpenOS 18.04.1 (rooted)"
287,"Why did you change the app? We just want a widget not a browser. How are you going to ever compete with Firefox or Chrome? Where are tabs or any other basic feature? Heck Firefox already has a privacy browser, so you failed in that regard as well.  I've uninstalled this app. If you ever want me to use it again, bring back a search widget and the option to use other browsers."
288,"OK. Privacy beats G. Settings default when closed & have to reset every time. Default settings are lame: short list, click on result, no new tab"
289,"Not Sure How This Is Any Better Than Using DDG In My Browser. What advantages are there to the app version? No tabs, no customization, etc. I don't see the point. Enlighten me. And by the way, the ""stories"" aren't a draw for me. I don't see that feature as a reason to keep the app. Tell me what makes this better than the browser version when it has less features and maybe I'll raise you a star."
290,"Recent update changes tabs view to tiles, with no option to see list view (as from before the update). I usually have 20-30 tabs open at once. The new view makes it frustrating to navigate. Switching back to Chrome pending an option to change this. If this isn't an issue for you, then the browser is great otherwise."
291,"Locks up a LOT, requiring close/reopen, oft repeatedly, apparently if it finds anything on a page it does not ""like"". May not ever open some pages other browsers handle just fine. Cannot save pages, pics, vids, or even highlight and save text from pages, in most cases. This reduced functionality supposedly needed to increase browser security? Not sure how much more secure it is, but it is barely a browser, in many ways."
292,Not that good sorry I don't mean to say this as a negative because I like browsing the internet with privacy but it doesn't work well I have the latest phone with the latest update Android but you just you have to do a few extra steps that you don't have to do with Google even though I don't like Google I don't like what they stand for but you have to do a few extra steps if you want to type you got to type everything you can't speak it out it won't let you it's just a few little bugs ro work ou
293,I 'm giving 1 star coz if Google play have option for 0 star rating so I definitely give it u seriously this is Most worst app I have ever seen in my life after beeing downloading this web browser it doesn' t show any download box where I was downloaded my files and the bad part is the files that I have downloaded they can't open pathetic app please don't download this I seriously recommended you and if u do u will regret after that! 😠👎👎
294,Defaults to DDG browser with no option to use another. Makes research very difficult when sending links to others and being able to save resources. The old search bar widget they had was more functional.
295,"Needs work, app is half baked 1. Put address and search bar at bottom 2. Tab management needs work, horizontal tab switching would be good addition. Create manage tabs to be put in bottom screen. 3. No toggle control over pop-up and notification block is present. I love the whole concept of duck duck go of not sharing and storing data for tracking, thumps up for your initiative."
296,"Did love this app. But have since tested app with Panopticlick (which I trust - check it out) and find that protection against trackers is only partial. I am testing other browser apps and find others such as Brave and Firefox give full protection. Please explain. I will never trust 'claims again and will always test and suggest others do too. Now I will use duck duck go search engine only with Brave or Firefox = no trackers. All trackers must go, no exceptions."
297,DO NOT TRUST!!! It saves all your searches in plain text in a root directory you can't navigate to unless you have root and a file manager. There's nothing private about this browser. Anyone with root can prove this.
298,"They need to replace the keyboard input mode whenever you begin a search. As it stands now, opening the app will begin with the keyboard in web address mode, meaning you have to type spaces between every word. When's the last time you've needed to manually enter a web address? l want to use this app as a search program, but it functions more like a browser at the moment. I've made suggestions to change this, but no luck so far."
299,"Well I like this in as web browser on desktop, but developers you need to work on it a lot. By lot I mean, let me help you point wise: 1. First maximum time if a person wants to download a file it gets downloaded thru internal application of phone and not by the browser itself. Like I was downloading an mp3 file. 2. There is no tab option and downloads option. 3. There should be share option. 4. View as desktop option. 5 after integration of download option, it should have pause and resume option, take cue of UC browser.   Lots of work to do guys. Best of luck to you. Once fully developed this will be my primary browser instead of chrome and UC browser"
300,Works well when it works. Recent update (probably last two weeks) has caused intermittent crashes of the application when opening in-window options on webpages. Easy to replicate on any shopping site: the site will freeze and no other tabs will load past the halfway point. Only fix is to burn tabs and restart the whole app. Not currently usable.
301,"The new update: the app can't be used as the default assist app anymore. I would use DuckDuckGo to pull up a search window by long pressing on the home button.  Now using Home Launcher to long press home button, go to Firefox Focus, search from there."
302,Good browser but if you have 75 -100 or more favorites / bookmarks in different categories it is too time consuming to scroll through the list. It's just a mass of disorganization. You might as well retype your search in the browser. It can be faster than scrolling the list. It's the only thing that turned me to another browser otherwise it would be my main choice. Can't compromise on this matter. Great otherwise.
303,"Is it really ""private""??? On the previous update, the browser starts automatically whenever it wants...which seems to question the whole ""privacy"" policy. I'll be giving this browser ZERO stars because it never used to auto start. I'm also uninstalling because google gives better search results. And I had to put ONE star for this to post 😩"
304,"I was enjoying this app until today, I'm trying to do a simple search in a bible verse, through the widget, it continues to say page not available, once I can get the main duck duck go page up only then I can complete my search, is this more censorship from big tech?? this was a 5 star app, until this issue, it's not even worthy of the 1 star rating I gave it"
305,"It's a fine app, but I don't need a browser. Option to open search results in default browser is gone. I just needed a search app that replaced Google. I'll just open Firefox Focus and search from there I guess."
306,"One terrible flaw. This app is awesome. But something that absolutely drives me nuts is...you search something, you're browsing around and your screen goes dark because you haven't tapped it in a while. You awaken the screen and boom...you're back to the original search even though you didn't hit the back button. The url is still in the search bar, but when you hit search nothing happens! You have to entirely exit the app to begin a new search."
307,The search engine stores words used in Internet and browser searches even after clearing data or having data storage set to off. The only way to clear search words is to clear the data cache through the android system. They need to fix this issue and not include words used in online searches in the Android system data cache. It also crashes a lot during playback.
308,"I would like bookmarks toolbar please. Also extension add-on ability like ublock, Facebook container alike but maybe better? Other than that information, and options on blocking tracking, and cookies. This app has good potential but needs those few things to be. This browser has good potential, but unfortunately i cannot use it as main, because of these things."
309,"It's okay. It's really lacking an app-handoff option. It tries to open everything in the browser, but sometimes I want to click on a link, like YouTube, and have it open the YouTube app on my phone. I searched the settings and options, but couldn't find a way to do this. If/When they add this, I'll update this review."
310,"Vertually unusable, as the browser keeps freezing. Very disappointing as I wanted to use this one. Even worse since last update... And no better after the newest update again. How hard can it be!"
311,"Giving it a try and so far, it needs some work. Specifically as the supporting search algorithm is concerned. When searching a location or business, it will give you a bing map, but no option for the place's website or contact info at all, then shows a list of completely unrelated stuff after getting the initial search item right. I would happily take their website over the location on a bing map any day of the week. Especially if I'm looking for info vs driving. Vast majority of the time."
312,"Used to love this app, but I hate the new interface updates. Why is there no setting to change the list of tabs back into a 'list view' like the old versions instead of the stupid thumbnails? Why is there no option to disable the annoying word-bubble pop-up things (""I blocked this for you, high five!""), for those that just want the app to shut up and let us browse? Certain parts of this update are good, but rolling out bad interface changes with no option to revert them is just bad form..."
313,"unpolished I really want to like the app, but I simply can't enjoy the experience. it's simply a mobile wrapper for DDG website. ideally, it should display search results in the app, while having the option to open links in a third party btowser, just like Google app does. right now, there's simply no reason for me to use the app when setting a search engine in a browser works just the same."
314,The only reason I downloaded this app was to download hindi music songs as duck duck go search don't hide site links for copyright issues unlike Google. But the app kept telling me to install uc browser and didn't take me to the download page. Had to uninstall it. Will keep going to duck duck go search and download from there from my chrome browser. I wanted to rated 1 star.
315,The browser needs refinement I would like it to store the sites I visit the most in tiles only for my own use until I burn the info. As well I would like to be able to add my own selected news feeds to the home page and private browsing tab separate from main history. Very much like opera mobile in layout. But I really do like the privacy and how responsive the browser is so far.
316,"A good enough browser, with a built in website privacy rating and data purger. It also has a dark theme which is nice. It is missing a few key features though, such as being able to view you recent browsing history, and a separate ""secret"" or incognito mode that more mainstream browsers have. A notable bug I ran into was that the ""request desktop"" button did nothing, not even on the duckduckgo search page. Were these problems resolved, it would be an excellent replacement for preinstalled browser"
317,1. All browsers should have the ability to backup bookmarks; this can be as simple as saving bookmarks to a file so bookmarks can be retrieved from the file. ** 2. Bookmark folders to organize/ group bookmarks. ** 3. Home button as the majority of other browsers. **4. Tabs on the Tab Page are FAR too easy to accidentally delete and since there's no tab history no way to recover.
318,"Literally no option to turn off autoplay on site videos, which are, besides privacy violations, the most annoying issue with websites. Find another browser until DuckDuckGo implements the basic ability to block autoplay by default. And no way to turn off JavaScript. Both these flaws make this browser all but useless."
319,"DDG is THE best search engine for results, but the recent overhaul in Jan 2018 totally lamed as a search app. Doesn't work as Android search & assist app (on Pixel) and no option to send links to default browser.  Recommend folks who want a search engine, rather than a browser, find and install an apk of version 3.1.1. hope DDG enables the old features as well."
320,"Use to like ur engine and browser, but dont need the search auto fill and recommendations. Also hate your new widget for smartphones. You upgraded but took 3 steps back. You were known for safe browsing and privacy but now youre no better than the other competitor's garbage."
321,Please stop the opening of new tabs everytime i go to another bookmark. I hate having to close multiple tabs when i read the news. Make a setting change that allows the option of staying on one tab from one bookmark to another. Chrome doesn't open a new tab for every new bookmark opened.
322,"Sad, no angry!  uninstalling instead Use startpage search I value my privacy so for years I used  recommended this search engine but NOT anymore!  Stories promoting homosexual agenda plus pro abortion have NO place on my search engine ! If I  I wanted that knowledge I would search! I want a choice for blank page with search. You have forced me no alternative but to return to invasion of privacy search engines! I also want choice to either view don't just  download videos.   Please give us a choice for front page without news page. I will change to 5* when this is done. Bye bye duck duck go hitting uninstall! Your dead to my phone and computer! I just installed startpage search it's awesome! The search has clean page, NO NEWS,  use their own proxy if you choose, complete privacy saves nothing!"
323,"Never in my whole life I've hated anything like I'm hating this stupid browser. It continuously stops loading the pages and I need to close it and open it again, extremely frustrating. It also doesn't remember the origin of a page after restarting, which means that if it freezes and I restart it, and it opens on the last seen page, when I try to go back it goes blank. And there is no chronology, which means, if by mistake I close a tab, I can't find it again. Whoever designed this is a loser..."
324,"Hey DuckDuckGo. I've had a decent experience using your app, but there's a problem. Sometimes I will tap a link to a site, but it shows an error with no reason except, ""connection refused"". This has been happening especially often with links that go to hydroxychloroquine-related sites and studys. I pasted the failing link to my firefox browser...and it goes to the site. It was a completely safe site, too. No reason to block it. I'd continue to use this app if there was no suspicious censorship."
325,"With the new update on 2/8/20, it force closes without a error message. As others have mentioned, when a link is clicked it opens in a new tab. However, that's not the problem. The problem is when going back, it takes you to a blank screen."
326,"I would give it more stars, but a lot of times when I search things on it, stories about what I search appear on my google news feed, even though I rarely use google search. Also, a lot of ads that appear while browsing on duckduckgo are related to things I have searched on duckduckgo. It seems rather suspicious, considering that they market themselves as a privacy browser. Something isn't quite right."
327,"Great concept and I do actually like the search engine better than google. However, the app is still a bit buggy for many websites, and the browser will occasionally open the desktop version of a website while on mobile. I would like to have the option, but not as a default. I would also like to be able to open multiple tabs at once. Overall it is a decent app with a few minor details to be worked out and I am looking forward to the next update."
328,"This app is crap! It has nothing to do with Tor. It doesn't function like Tor, as Tor Browser is one of the fastest browsers around. I went to a site and tried to download a simple Anime. And I couldn't get the screen to enlarge, without it trying to load a toatle dif page."
329,"This app is worthless! after multiple attempts to search for something, the app failed to pull it up, so I tried putting the term in quotation marks, & it gives me the same results in a different order! what is the use of being more secure browser when you can't get to the results you ask for? Like exploring a cave without any light. & being told now you don't have to worry about setting of any gas explosions! You can't see to explore, so what's the point of trying to explore the cave? DELETE!!!!"
330,"Love it so far, fast response time in searches. A few criticism with regards to image searching on android mobile though: First, when I select an image from the results it seems to 'float'. Tapping once doesn't always bring up the 'view source' option so it can be frustrating to save pics since it doesn't let me long press to save. Second, I can't change the download location for images. They save to a unique 'pictures' folder instead of my 'downloads'."
331,"Please set new tabs up top, not where I have to scroll all the way to the bottom through 90 tabs every time I go back into my tabs. It's incredibly annoying and makes me hate this app a little more every time. I'm quite sure everyone else would agree. Please change it or add an option to switch the order. If you change this I'll change my rating and update my review. Thanks"
332,At first it was a good app with promising privacy.....but after a post in GitHub saying it takes your data in Mobile browser I had stopped using the browser but still continuing it in other browser like Firefox.I would recommend you to use the Duck Duck Go search engine in other browser rather than it's browser or use other search engine like start page etc.
333,"I'm about to stop using this brawser because when I press some links or videos it redirects to ads pages, the other brawsers redirect in a second window, but the duckduckgo does it in the same page that I'm using. This happens a lot of times and most times it is necessary to close the page and open again to be able to use. Is it possible to block the redirection in the duckduckgo or redirect to a second page ??? I like the privacy policy, therefore I only use this browser in my phone."
334,The interface is very slow. And if this app does not store data then why in the settings when I see this app's storage then it shows that there is some data stored. Apart from that in other search engines we can view the previously viewed tabs(if we have not removed them) but in this one is not able to do the same. Please resolve this issue otherwise I will be forced to uninstall this app
335,"Poor effort. Who in their right mind thought ""i know, everytime a user does anything we'll have a notification that slooooowly appears on the screen and has to be cleared before they can do anything else, even viewing the site they went to in the first place""? Really? What a joke. Looks like im stuck with google until someone cracks this obviously hugely difficult task of viewing a web page on a mobile and it not being a frustrating experience."
336,This latest update has broken the app completely. Now whenever i search something or visit a new website the pages don't show up on my screen. The screen remains completely blank even if the page has been loaded
337,Changed from a search engine to a browser with no option to use default browser. Don't need another browser app. Thanks but no thanks. Will use web page instead
338,"Good browser..but some areas where it lags tonuc browser: 1. It doesn't provides zoom in feature in a page wherein the font size and the matter adjusts to page width only, one doesn't have to swipe right and left to read time and again. 2.basic feature such as history bar, so one can search any older webpage. 3.no download section to refer downloaded files directly. So developers, not just speed matters, in this competitive world , you have to be on ur toes"
339,"search results are often completely wrong/bizarre so of little use to me. Ive now been told that google now own this browser,some under counter deal done. Explains why it doesnt stop google tracking you,and why its started to get ""clunky"",often pausing for no reason.. Not whats it was originally intended to be thats for sure.. :( Ive also no idea why it keeps activating the camera but its well suspect imo.none of my other browsers does that. Sticky tape over cam lens haha.fkem."
340,App has some bugs that they need to sort out. Sometimes my keyboard won't pop up if i click the search bar. That hasn't happened with any other browser. Also for some annoying reason even though i save the dark mode it always switches to light mode when i kill the app from the background and open it again after. Other than that their interface needs polishing and upgrading. The side bar is clunky and feels like its from 2007. Other than that this app is pretty awesome
341,"Makes safer and more private browsing easy on mobile, but not without problems. You can't see the full URL of links without opening them, and you have no control over what's blocked, which means you can't whitelist as needed, e.g. to get media to display properly on certain sites. I'm a huge fan of DuckDuckGo's philosophy, but their search engine and browser still have a ways to go before they can replace their tracker-laden counterparts."
342,"l think Google are hacking you, every time l search for anything using your browser, a full page ""Google user you have won"" ad fills the whole page and can't be closed. The only way out is to close the page and app."
343,"user agent although you have facilitated use of orbot tor anonymity proxy, this is unlikely to obscure a user's tracks much, since you freely pass a virtually unique user agent id through to the destination web server. i expected better. really all this app does in the current form is capture users to your search engine, presumably then passing the search through to your advertising co-conspiratator fiends at bing. i expected better. oh. and the settings page is tricky to access, can't locate it until after performing a search. wierd."
344,"It performs as advertised, but didn't meet my needs. I've been using Samsung Browser's 'Secret Mode' for some of my browsing, but it blocks Geo Location which I wanted to use; so I thought I'd give this DuckDuckGo browser a try. Not only is Geo Location still blocked, but when I log in to a website that requires a subscription (and therefore credentials), the site does not fully recognize that I am logged in as a subscriber. Now I figured this might be that the site itself requires a cookie to maintain state information, which by design this browser blocks; but this still makes it unusable for me. If the browser had settings options that would offer me to allow cookies and Geo Location, especially if this could be set for each individual site and/or on a one-at-a-time basis, then my needs would be meet. In other words, I need to be able to occasionally override the strict privacy features from time to time."
345,"Hmm.. What to say. Does it work? Yes. Is it optimised for USA users? Yes. We'll that's no good for me as a Brit. Searches typically return US sites first and maps uses apple maps... Apple don't even use apple maps anymore hence finally allowing Google maps on thier devices. For those reasons I cannot fall in love with this browser, in fact it makes my time on the Web a little more challenging than using, for example, Google chrome (I hate chrome ☹️)"
346,"Great browser, search engine gets the job done without censoring your results or tracking your activity. update: got a new phone LG G8 and search bar widget cant be added to home screen"
347,"There is no option for incognito as it is blended in as a burn all cookies and data button. Which would be cool if it were for a seperate incognito mode. Plus, there is no way to refresh a page. So you have to somehow get back to the page your on somehow without pressing back then clicking on the part that took you to that page. The search browser is great, but the app isn't. Plus opera lets you use duck duck go on it on its app. It has a built in vpn for incognito mode you can turn on"
348,"This app doesn't block trackers I'm getting the same scam mail I will be deleting it and getting something that shows it's working, it always says zero block, when I know for sure I'm still unsafe, it doesn't do it explain anything about it when I click on it, I gave it one star that's low as I could go, I feel like it's just another app taking storage space, it's not doing anything here as I can see, then I tried reading reviews before download no chance"
349,"Trash. It looks good and all but it's very terrible to use. It has glitches sometimes you can't scroll up it just reloads the page when you try to. Desktop version of sites never works. There are known issues with the searches from desktop version anyway same thing here, many images, links, local sites not having priority in search. Wrong meaning of privacy, it can't do what you want cause that would do what duckduckgo does: limit the browser, searches. Going back to stock browsers. :)"
350,"great. another browser. all i need is a duckduckgo widget that allows me to search for stuff, and browse with firefox. worked fine with the old app, with the new one i can't even copy links, unless i open them, and copy from the address bar."
351,Dropped to 2 stars. App now shows open tabs 6 per screen instead of showing the tabs title bars. Much more work visually to find a specific tab. Too bad.
352,"Slightly slower but i have no problem with a lil less speed vs more privacy, why did the search bar stop showing what sites were trying to track me and you stopping them I actually like seeing what noisey trackers were being stopped! Revision: it would appear you aren't as forthcoming as I was led to believe and I have had to stop using your browser"
353,"Sorry, terrible app. I found it very slow to load pages . Also, whatever you searched for last , stays when you reopen the app to use again . This issue becomes a bigger problem when the new pagr you're searching for won't load because the previous page is still trying to open .. if that makes sense . I also really didn't like image results , at all ... I was hopeful as I'm trying to use Google less ."
354,"We are talking about accessing deep web and sure there are a hell lot of popup ads and windows, while using Firefox and chrome, they open the popup window in new window that is very good but in duck duck go, the freaking website ads open up on the same page and thus, you can never access the page content. Ugotta.fixit()"
355,"Everything functions properly, exept for when I had a tab open and closed the app. Now the app doesn't respond to anything I tap and crashes after partially loading the web page. Nice browser."
356,"edit reinstalling will try again but 3 stars is after months trying to want to use, trust, and often use this app. or the search engine I know the results are more private but if it takes 50 pages to find a simple page while not becoming click bait or worse maybe I'm wrong or some settings or my end but it's not a reliable source 50 % of the time I find my self swapping to Google or others because wuth Google or bing's etc filtering or results but if I search 20 times and get page results so off"
357,Actually its not good but its ok. Interface is not user friendly like in chrome we can access all major sites nd latest news etc at opening of app only...!!! Nd one more prblm i encountered is while downloading i ws unable to see it as there ws no download tab by which we can see % of download...!!! Keep improving guyz...!!! There is lot u hv to do...!!! Good Luck But i hv listen tht google is owner of duck duck go so wht about privacy?
358,Not sure if or how privacy is better or different but I'd change it to 4 or 5 stars if they would fix it to where when you select open in new tab it didn't close tab your in and jump to new tab if it did it like chrome or Firefox where it opens new tab but keeps you on same page or at least have option of doing it that'd b so much better
359,"This browser is one of the best browsers, but some fitures are missing which should include. Some like one tap bookmark option or back button shoud close the last tab, download tab option."
360,"Takes up quite a bit of space, or I might keep it for sensitive sites only - eg if you have several banking apps, it could replace them all. Can't replace another browser, as most offer this one's ""special"" features (deleting history/cookies etc) and this doesn't offer anything else. If you want to retain your cookies etc, it nags about it in notifications (occasionally). For me it's not useful, even though I love DDG for its principles and it's always my default search engine."
361,"The biggest issue I've had is eventually pages stop loading due to some memory issue. I'm not sure if it's my device (Pixel 2 XL) or the app but I think it's the app based on my observations. If I force stop and clear the cache, it works. Before doing that, Firefox, Opera, and Chrome all load the same pages, under similar conditions (~6 tabs open under each), and none of them have to load/redraw. DDG Browser still stays in memory and doesn't reload...the pages just stop loading."
362,"This is originally a search engine and its main feature is privacy and it gives you that. Now, as a browser leaves a great deal to be desired. It has very few setting options. In my case is important that it has a data saving option."
363,"My gripes: The new tabs page does not work well on a small screen, and with a slow processor. The creation of the thumbnails takes time, and the 'x' for deleting the tab is way too hard to hit with a normal finger. When returning to a page from the tabs page, the keyboard is often activated. *Very* irritating!"
364,"It used to be a pretty good browser. Now if I open more than one tab, and then look at the tab list, no matter what I tap it goes back to an empty screen. Background tabs are pretty useless if you can't open the for viewing."
365,"Simple browser thats easy to use, offers very few user settings and menu options,  does give browsing history privacy as in an incognito browser would provide, needs ad blocking or something along those lines. It's okay just not for me."
366,Got to question why a browser that is supposed to protect my privacy is spending so much time trying to send back telemetry with no option for me to switch it off.
367,"The back button behavior needs a lot of work. I open a new tab from a page when I click back I should return to previous page, but no I only see empty page with DDG logo. So annoying behavior."
368,"The whole idea of DuckDuck Go in a nutshell is a ""constant private mode"". You will get ads, your provider or the admin of your network will still be able to see what you are doing. They are a business in the end and make money by showing you adds. So if you are getting this just to have privacy, don't bother. It's not better than say opera's private mode. To be fair their engine and ui are good. I see no reason why anyone would get this instead of Firefox or any other major browser."
369,"Breaks too many websites! Request desktop version generally never loads the desktop version!! No way to override privacy settings when required, especially GPS location! Moved to a different browser for the mean time and will switch back if these problems for the very vast amount of times loads and does what it is supposed to do."
370,"Just migrated from the hideous Firefox update. So far I like this browser, but I hate the homepage layout. I want to be able to set my homepage in setings, to the DDG site search page. This seems impossible. Am I missing something? Will you add this option? I just want a clean DDG search page like the website. Orherwise it's good. Fast and simple."
371,"A god awful dysfunctional mess. It hijacks any other search engine I try to use, is slower than molasses in January and mostly just tells me it is searching until it times out. A colossal time wasted, soon to be uninstalled unless it is made functional. Every time I try to launch it, the screen freezes. When the wait close or report icon pops up, I click report, the screen goes black, and a page headed "":Google Legal "" pops up, wanting me to agree to terms of service. I think Google does it"
372,"Another News feed for Reddit Prefer the web browser based search engine. Also if it's meant to be anonymous searching why does your search history show up? Finally maybe I don't want you to see my email address when submitting recommended search page feeds, why can't I suggest or customise them from within the app?"
373,"Is not a privacy browser.All history is in google settings under web activity and other activity.I had to give it one star in order to post this,otherwise it would be negative 10 stars.Private means private not kept else where , completly false advertisement."
374,"I love that DuckDuckGo doesn't allow websites to track my every move and doesn't sell my information! However, it needs a lot of polishing. Frequently when I try to enter text, my keyboard won't appear unless I minimize and reopen the window. Recently websites will appear as an entirely white screen until I force close the app, then reopen. Last, when I type something into the widget words do not auto space. Fixing these bugs would result in a five star rating from me."
375,"Not stable. Freezes often. Sometimes when you share the link to a page you are viewing via text and then close texting, the browser will close all of your links and revert back to the homepage. It's got some efficiency and error trapping issues in the coding. Also, if you close the browser and come back, it doesn't seem to be a way to view any of the pages that you had open. Clean Slate each time."
376,"download didn't pop up for a day, now that I finally got it. When I go to add the widget, it says home has stopped and to close app. WHY??? Also I'd like to know how safe it is surfing your app without getting bugs, spam and viruses. As well how do I clear history and cookies soit doesn't eat up memory? And what is the difference between Google , Chrome and Duck Duck Go. For example, usually people say use Chrome search engine over Google. Why is that and are You better than Fire Fox?"
377,"Updates messed up scrolling, if I overshoot something and try to scroll back up, it seems to lock up for a moment and reloads the page sending me back to the top... real annoying to find the same spot on longer pages. Please fix this. UPDATE, on top of above issue app would switch or close windows spontaneously...had to uninstall. If yours works, DO NOT INSTALL ANY UPDATE"
378,"The browser is very outdated and doesn't block ads. When an ad opens a new tab with a click, its hard to get back to previous tab i was browsing. Instead of bringing back to the previous tab. This browser closes the application and exits to home screen. This irritates a lot. Uninstalling.."
379,"The Browser does its job well. it does what it promises. The Privacy and Tracker Ratings for websites are really very useful. However the real issue is with the search Engine. You do understand that there are many Websites hosting content which are unethical by even the most liberal standards and even an innocuous, accidental click could land a surfer in severe trouble and legal complexity. So I urge you to moderate your results better. This is ONE area where Google is still better than you."
380,I only use DDG search wherever I can. I used to love this as a search app that opened in another browser (Brave). I had it replacing Google search on my phone. With most recent update it changed to a browser with only one tab. This is a huge inconvenience for me.  Unistalled until it is reverted or an option to open all links and searches in another browser.
381,Try our new search widget? If you click it it opens up the browser? You can't even type in it. What's the use?
382,"If I'm on the web or images every time I want to go back one page it always takes me back to the main page and I have to reenter what im looking for again. Plus on the main page I have to search web before I can pick another category, would be nice to have these options on the main page. Other than that I like it."
383,Not view ads related to my search or view any page. If try to edit the url and latter cancel then URL goes missing from the address bar. Please fix the issue
384,The browser occasionally fails to load Web pages and I have to reboot the phone to fix it. Nevertheless I was happy to do this occasionally as this was my favourite browser. Unfortunately a few days ago the tab view has been changed to big square tiles (which I find unusable) with no way to change it back. Time to look for an alternative browser I think.
385,"back button from a newly-opened tab does not take you back to the original page/tab that you started from. while the browser has some nice features, until this issue is fixed, the app is unusable."
386,"I am a GOOGLE GIRL! This browser sounded awesome & what it says it does, or rather doesn't do I thought I'd give it a go. I'm afraid it didn't last. I searched for an item, lots of websites were offered, I chose one. I then tried to register on the website. All I got was a white page saying, 'Failed Connection. Please Try Later'. I went to a different website, same problem. GOOGLED what I wanted, the same sites visited, registered with both within seconds.So still a GOOGLE GIRL!"
387,"An excellent option for privacy minded users who want a no nonsense, no frills experience (like Firefox users who don't like the Daylight upgrade). Those desiring a more complete and well rounded experience should look for either Vivaldi, Brave, or the aformentioned Firefox (my personal favorite), but those who find those experiences overwhelming or unsatisfying for whatever reason should be happy with this, especially if they like the browser extension for desktop."
388,I trust DDG search engine and use it on all my devices be it PC or Handheld devices. I just dowloaded this app on my android now and used it for about 10 minutes. Noticed too many and too frequent intrusive ads. Which by the way moves me from my current tab and takes me to the new tab by force. So me rating this DDG app miserly is entirely based on the intrusive and annoying ads.
389,"The Widget Ruins It!! If your screen locks or you click the home button, your page disappears.  If you try to search again after this happens, it won't let you and you have to close the app."
390,"No dark/night mode.. If pres back key , browser exit without asking Need multiple windows in list view It's better Setting menu placed in below.. currently it's in right top"
391,"Can't see point. Clearing all data still leaves 15-20 meg in app data. Clicking on Google (not signed in) still shows what my location is within a couple of miles ""From your search history"" Chrome incognito still seems a better option."
392,"No configuration, buggy 1. Can't disable safe search. Filters random things like ""Kawasaki ZX-10R"" and you can't view any results. 2. Disabling JS in the settings breaks functionality on the search page itself �?viewing image results should not require such a complex system. And, although slightly unrelated, ddg's homepage scroll-jacks on the quote/review area disabling touch based scrolling in a lame attempt to add custom-built swipe support instead of just using the standard."
393,more specific options that Chrome makes available would be helpful ie: translation of foreign language sites and a browsing history archive (I know that's the whole point of browsing data collection) are two things I miss! Like image insertion would be awesome!!! And really how Private is this app when one MUST HAVE CHROME... The only thing i'm finding helpful at this point is the search isn't CENSORING AS MUCH in the results!!!
394,"I like DuckDuckGo as a search engine but, unless I'm missing something, the browser blocks all cookies (or deletes them after visiting, even though I didn't press the fire icon) so in the EU I get asked if I want to allow cookies every time I visit a Web site which is rather tedious unfortunately."
395,"Lately, website links don't open. when I tried to undo the default browser setting, it opens to another unrelated window. returning to the settings page causes the default browser setting switch to reset itself. there doesn't seem to be a way to undo it except to uninstall this app. pity, it showed so much promise."
396,I enjoy the feature of closing the tabs and clearing the history. I'd like this app better if it would clear cookies out at more frequent interval. I like thr new feature of letting me know when it blocked trackers. Some way to have bookmarks/ favorites would better very nice also.
397,"Annoying that it seems obsessed with opening new tabs every time you click on a bookmark. Would be good to turn that off in the options. Also refresh by swiping down would be handy. Doesn't handle pdfs, ""could not open file"" error message"
398,in my email account i am unable read my email. i can see address to but nothing else. there is no history saved but a data cleared option looks like its a decorative piece as users cant return to former pages. smh also as im searching i must key in my search multiple times just so it would locate my request. honestly as time goes so does every thing else. like all search engines just have some hiccup they refuse to inform the people. gosh i miss the 90's. mid 90's that is.
399,"I like the privacy this browser offers, but one feature of this app is mildly annoying to infuriating. Hitting the 'back' button on my phone allows me to go a page back, but going past the original page typed in exits the app and I need to renavigate to the site all over again. I was just now filling out a form with many fields and lost all data because the app exited from hitting back one too many times. Chrome and Ghostery never did this and it's incredibly annoying."
400,"While I love the focus on privacy (the 🔥 button should be in all mobile browsers), this is lacking some very basic features. No tabs, can't full-screen videos, no password manager... I'll check it out again after it matures some."
