0,"Supposed to be able to edit, but crashes each time I hit the edit button."
1,Need some sort of an update for this app.
2,"Did that, except in Settings, there was no ""Support"" button, thus, no ""Send Activity Log""  And, here I am paying for the ""Premium"" feature of Evernote."
3,"Having said that, the tablet version of Evernote is a very poor excuse of an attempt to create something that works."
4,"I have found another program that works, and works well."
5,"One step forwards, two steps backwards (UPDATE#2)   Material design is in the right direction, BUT The overlap text bug that was fixed in the previous version IS BACK."
6,"Also, the formatting bar is taking more space on a tablet, when it used to share the space with the top bar."
7,"(UPDATE#1)  Another bug unfortunately is when I paste an image from Chrome, only a small pink box appears."
8,"When I save the note, I can see the image fine, but now I am unable to edit the note properly because it tells me that the ""format is not supported""."
9,"This app doesn't have some sort of front page like imgur has for example, instead all we get is the ""discover"" feature which only promotes bland, vague and uninteresting posts with no personality."
10,"All the posts featured there are just... unattractive, to say the least."
11,"There are no set categories or tags, instead you make them up and unless people type them up exactly like you did they won't see your post, which is counterintuitive and discourages finding new posts or bloggers."
12,The search bar doesn't work.
13,"All of these factors make it feel deserted and lacking of a community, and discourage new users of getting into writing or reading on WordPress."
14,New Upgrade = Loss of Functionality Evernote automatically updated on 9/4/14.
15,a little bit later I tried to start a new note (using the button on the old widget -- DONT touch that after you update to the latest version!!!)
16,"but instead of opening up a blank template for a new note, IT OPENED UP THE PREVIOUS UNEDITED VERSION OF MY OTHER NOTE... from before I spent all that time adding all the additional info."
17,"There is absolutely no way of cancelling out without uploading/saving it, so this POS app saved this version of my note, completely overwriting and eliminating all the additional info I had worked so hard to create."
18,"Tags are used instead of folders, so there's absolutely no separation between work or personal notes."
19,I'm slowly training myself to use OneNote because Evernote is becoming unusable due to the unresolved bugs.
20,"Then I have to delete the old version of the notebook if I made any change, but I it doesn't automatically update for me."
21,"The handwriting is a huge pain, pdf notation is quite confusing and doesn't work on my tablet or phone."
22,It takes forever to load the notebook too and the so called in text search function only works 1/3 of the time.
23,2015 Update - Evernote has officially jumped the shark by removing key offline functionality for free users.
24,You used to be able to view all notebooks (but not update them) while working offline.
25,"In this day and age of FREE, full functionality organizational apps like OneNote (font changes, sketching capabilities, email to app, etc), I don't see a reason to continue using Evernote."
26,"Problems, Problems, Problems!"
27,------------- Next I uninstalled & re-installed the app (for the 12th time trying to fix the vanishing maps problem).
28,"UPDATE- As shown below, the someone from the developer company posted suggestions."
29,UPDATE- Developer replied to this review and asked me for the name I used to contact them.
30,I will update the review & star rating when (if) they reply & tell me how to make this application work.
31,"I paid for the Evernote Plus to get the extra functionality on web and widget, and since the last update I regret this."
32,"It is now impossible to use saved searches in the widget, and that was what made it so useful."
33,But without the saved searches in the widget the whole thing is not half as handy as it used to be.
34,"NEW EDIT:Went from 3 to 1: since the new update, I get at least 2-3 times the message that my widget list could not be loaded, and that it has to do something with my wifi."
35,"This last update really really ruined the whole Evernote experience for me, to the extent that the widget is now completely useless, frustrating me and messing up my workflow on Evernote."
36,"There's no option to save here, and the *affirmative* choice *deletes* my edits (jeez, if you're not paying attention...)."
37,One of the main features I expected when I signed up for Evernote was to be able to allow my husband access to edit and share my notebooks and to be able to clip webpages.
38,I feel bad for all the loyal Evernote users that will probably have to upgrade to keep the features they use to have for free.
39,"Change the profile pic from the app was successful,new pic applied in WordPress web based,but in the blog owner comment reply list the blog owner gravatar still using the old previous profile pic,I wish there will be select all in Comment menu so user can select all spam comment n delete at once.Why if we change public name it doesnt change all the previous public name in older comments with new one!"
40,"The app relies on your device's keyboard autocorrect features, which is great....for phones."
41,"You have the ability to add in photos from your gallery or dowloads into notes, which is awesome in addition to my Chromebooks ""snippet"" feature, however you can NOT resize the image from within the app."
42,What I would  like to see changed is; - when searching the results show the downloaded  Map Name which can be confusing as it doesn't match the location of the  address.
43,However there are several big flaws or missing features that hinder me from making it 5 stars.
44,This is my number one problem that makes me lose a lot of time and sometimes by doing this it accidentally edits my text so I need to fix it.
45,"I  understand that they have to monetize it but at 1 million users, ad  impressions may have been a better route instead of a subscription service  that locks out the majority of your player base from the start."
46,The quick note option in the notification bar is not appearing for me.
47,"It does work offline for me which is 1 reason not to boot it just yet but its useless to navigate with, i use it just to look for trails."
48,"You need to disable the info sharing, apparently this app sells info on you 20 times more than other apps"
49,I used to love this and it worked really well for me.
50,"Now even basic words are shown as misspelled and there is no option to add a word to the dictionary I can no longer print individual pages, it is either all or nothing and that leads to a huge waste of paper."
51,You'd assume such a massively popular and old app that gets frequent updates would have had bugs like these fixed years ago...
52,Edit: Last update has drastically fixed the lag issue with long notes.
53,"I'm not sure if they fixed it on purpose or by mistake, but I'm not going to take any chances updating the app again after this in case the next update brings back the lag again."
54,I used to love this app and I use it a lot for work and personal info organisation.
55,"I used to be able to work on notes whether I was online or offline - a helpful little red exclamation symbol would appear on the sync item when the app couldn't sync because the internet was down, so I would be careful not to change to working on the same note on a different device."
56,I don't want to have to remove the sync setting as I do want the app to sync regularly when I'm online.
57,(NB the Windows 10 app update doesn't even appear to have the option to change the sync setting at all - in fact the settings menu seems to have disappeared completely!!!)
58,I tried being nice and simply asked you to remove my name devices and any notes or images you have for or from me in your system .
59,I have things working as they should... then an update like the latest wrecks everything.
60,Once upon a time this app worked beautifully and did what it should... you see... people posting from their phones are ON THE GO!
61,I just want to post quickly with no hassle- the control needed but not clutter.
62,What used to take seconds... select some pics on phone ... share to WP app... add text hit upload and DONE... is now futz with this and that ... fight the awful quirks ...hit post and wait wait wait...error.
63,Wrangle things back to where they work again....then get blitzed by the next update
64,"If I try to set multiple reminders for a task, it seems like it would allow it, but then it discards the second reminder time and only saves the first one."
65,Moving tasks up and down the list doesn't work properly (lags and jitters).
66,I can change it in the settings but tapping each option simply changes which one is active.
67,inconvinient interface The new update is as stylish and beautiful as it inconvenient and wrong.
68,"I didn't used all the new ""features"" so I'll comment only few of them."
69,"Note editing - After the last update, I need to roll up the note to make this little green circle appear."
70,Other options and business options could be charged?
71,EVEN MORE SAD: new free version rule is ONLY 2 DEVICES -&gt; BUT YOU CAN'T DISABLE or UNINSTALL on SAMSUNG PHONES!
72,SO I REAAALLY START TO HATE THIS APP: NOT BEING ABLE TO USE or REMOVE BUT BEING FORCED TO KEEP... AND UPGRADE... AND USE MY STORAGE!
73,"BUT, it lacks the very ""androidy"" things like color options for your lists or notes, color options for what you write in those notes, color options for the highlighter (damn it!!!!"
74,"Plus, the text editor could really use a remake... it doesn't behave like a normal text editor (like when using backspace, or enter, or other stuff...)."
75,"If I had purchased Premium on my work account, maybe I could share notebooks and sort of hack the same result, but I bought it for my personal account and still can't access my work account here."
76,If I currently have a good connection I want to be able to search a new area without having to download the section first.
77,"Searching by street name sometimes works, but often comes up empty."
78,"Creating a note is also laggish, I need to first click on + button and it takes like 0.5 seconds to pop up the menu which consists of many items out of which I have ever used one - ""text note""."
79,"Everything looks pretty good, but the Featured Image setting doesn't work."
80,"I add an image from my Media Library, then edit its properties...Check the box for ""Featured Image"" and then leave the box for ""Show in post"" unchecked, but it always just shows the image in the post and refuses to set it as the Featured image, no matter how many times I go back and try to edit it/redo it."
81,"It hadn't occurred to me to log out of the account on my old phone before doing a factory reset, so when I tried to synch the new one, Evernote saw it as a fourth device."
82,"Great App, wish tablet UI had better usability Love the Evernote application for its function (sharing across multiple platforms/users), but I wish the direction taken on the tablet UI was more like the PC, web and mobile app."
83,"UPDATE: After latest update, have to say the mobile (phone) UI is WAY more desireable than the tablet UI."
84,"Please consider syncing these up, or at least give us the option of which to install/use!"
85,"Went to create a blog post today using my WordPress app and discovered that the editor is some weird, useless version of what it was before."
86,"As well, the web based editor crashes EVERY SINGLE TIME I do an update to a blog."
87,"- - - I received an automated response to this review which said, ""You can switch back to the app's old editor: Go to App Settings in the app and toggle off the 'Show Visual Editor' option."
88,"This app doesn't allow you to link to your own earlier posts, crashes often, can sometimes delet your whole draft even unsave a previously update and saved page, and has issues previewing images."
89,It also cannot pull the most recent version of you updates which you created with the web editor.
90,"Woe be unto you if you mak long pots, because after a certain size copy/paste stop working and the editor gets so slow you have to wait for the displayed text to catch up to you."
91,I've used this app for years (since Verizon updated my operating system and deleted the inbedded note app - lost EVERYTHING) and it's always been buggy/difficult to use.
92,I tried sending an activity log but when I click on the option to submit a ticket (as you have advised others here to do).
93,"I have been using Evernote for 6 years, this issue is only since the last update."
94,"If I tried to type:  17:30 84 sg236 stop 4202  I get: 1:73330 84a ss23 ststop 420222 As you can see, when trying to keep a log it is utterly impossible and trying to go back and correct the errors just creates even more."
95,"I am writing this review because when I wanted to contact the support team , there is no option unless i ""UPGRADE"" meaning i have to pay money just to ""TALK TO THEM""  I am writing here to tell you that I have been using your Evernote App for many many years now."
96,There is no clean way to take back a button press (If you accidentaly pressed on + and didn't mean to your options are leave it as is even though you didn't earn the rewards or edit the task to include a minus option and take the HP hit).
97,"Creating a Daily and setting it to all days, then editing it and removing the current day still leaves the Daily Active (Same with the reverse if it was first created as not enabled for this day of the week, then editing and enabling it, it remains disabled)."
98,But it lacks polish around the edges and some bugs could be fixed.
99,"But I need to be able to quickly note the new lambs' weights and snap a quick picture, and now the app won't save edits I make outside, I think bcz WiFi is spotty in the field."
100,Can't I just work offline and sync in the house?
101,"I tried out a few competitors, decided i still love the way EVernote looks and works, and made a new note (Lambing Records 2017 Part II) - but it only took info for two ewe's lambs and then it was too small."
102,"Bugs, Bugs, Bugs in the Latest Update This app worked great and loved the material design update a couple weeks ago."
103,But the latest update has bugs that affected both my Android version and Mac version.
104,Hope they roll out a fix soon because I use Evernote a lot for work.
105,Some key features are buggy on this app such as adding new notebooks.
106,Please note that your new Web ui and this app delays my work as it takes forever to load.
107,"Poor implementation of a good idea I thought that the idea of being able to create notes and sync them between desktop and mobile phone was a great idea, as I find that working on my desktop PC for most things is much easier than doing the same on my phone."
108,"I like the idea of being able to insert images into my notes, which Evernote allows, but the Browser version does not allow insertion of new images between existing ones."
109,Another bug exists when trying to change the font characteristics of any text you have already typed into the note.
110,"But suddenly, after switching to Android, I've noticed that when I use the search key, it searches all my notes."
111,"It used to be that if I tapped that icon, it would search within that note, finding the key text right then and there, highlighting it."
112,Not able to find business tags on android nor on web version Since I switched to business evernote im not able to find notes by searching tags using android or the web version.
113,On top of that web version is very slow even with closed tags.
114,At least most of the features work in a general sense; just not in my area.
115,"I am aware you can opt out of most advertising by going to settings and switching off ""Show offers"", but there's no garuntee your app will stop giving other unwanted push notifications, such as the one asking if the user is aware of the bookmarking feature."
116,"DO NOT engage the user outside of the app unless it is for a currently requested function or feature they are actively using, such as continuing navigation while in the background."
117,"The notes you type in the web version are not fully compatible with the app version, which is really frustrating."
118,"The biggest complaint I have is how many privacy permissions they gave themselves - the latest update gives them a new permission, to add, create, delete, and set passwords for user accounts on the device."
119,"They also have permission to read and copy your contacts, to read your phone call status, to track how often you text or call each of your contacts!"
120,"There is no setting featured image, adding a gallery and unless you modify the dimensions of the photo you insert, it will maintain the full size."
121,"The view mode shows the updated info, but when I edit it, it's outdated."
122,"Also when I edit it it tells me ""this note contains some unsupported formatting"" and says ""This version of evernote does not support inline editing of webclips..."" Funny thing is that it's not a webclip."
123,"HTC Aria  UPDATE: Okay, still not sure why it wasn't updating some notes, but the ""webclip"" problem seemed to be caused by inserting ""horizontal rules"" into the note."
124,"Kept this app on one phone in meantime in case later updates solve the storage problems, but unlikely as it is policy."
125,"Expecially after the updates of the last months, the app shows issues that make it not usable:  -it cannot make a path on a map not updated (and if you are abroad without Internet and unlucky enough to miss the update, you cannot use the app, which denies the usefulness of it); -you cannot zoom on the rough map if you do not download the detailed map first, so you cannot get an idea of zones you did not download (not even the zones that are clearly visible on the rough map when not zooming); -full of pop-ups and messages you cannot remove, covering the map and being extremely annoyng; -the ""search"" option is horrible, sometimes cannot find even extremely famous places (try searching ""San Marco"" in Venice...)."
126,I used to give this app 5 stars but recent years' updates have rendered it almost useless for me.
127,I use it to list my stamp sets (paper crafting) and punches but now I can't edit photos before saving them in a note and today search is not working.
128,"For example, this Android version does not support the same (basic) formating of the desktop version, meaning I can not work solely on my tablet if I want to structure my note text in a way that makes it more meaningful and easier to read."
129,"Or, to have your notes available off line, you have to select each note book, one at a time, make a few clicks to set it to keep it off line, and then you have to wait while that syncs because if you try the next, the dialog keeps popping away before you can use it, until the pervious one is synced."
130,"And event this would be OK, if Evernote would listen and act on these annoyances, but instead they go on a develop new features for their new business ideas, and leave the chance for a great product lagging."
131,"Reduction of performance Useful app plus web tutorials are great however, it is slow, to do lists are clumsy and do not allow for removing completed tasks easily."
132,"Finally, business card scanning is missing and there is a persistent error when trying to use the page scanner."
133,"3) I lost the whole text and images of a new post because of an internet connection error, this should not happen no matter how bad the connection is, offline editing is what users expect from an application vs the web-admin!"
134,4) post settings button is hidden when keyboard is open 5) can't edit site url 6) can't batch upload local charges
135,I liked this app at first because of the emmense amount of features to make very customizable notes and list from check boxes and formatting.
136,"The load time for a list is ""unbearably"" long (two seconds may seem like nothing but cumulatively from opening app everytime you switch screens whether loading a 1 line list, saving, or just pressing back)."
137,UI poor & buggy; connectivity & state-saving bugs; unintuitive & hazy.
138,"The social/game features (custom avatars &c.) are steeply ramped to try to drive pay-for-play schemes, so the appeal to some of a casual showoff/hangout sort of play are curtailed."
139,"Missing ""do not download"" option in map diwnload dialog window."
140,"Calculating a route is slow, arrival estimation changed from optimistic (below 4h) to pessimistic (over 8h) for a route Krapkowice-Warszawa (Poland, realistic estimate ca 5h)."
141,"Train stations are well-marked and it's pretty easy to follow along with your reason trip to know how much further you need to go and where to get off (note that the routing itself i s by driving rather than public transport, which would have been a nice feature, but that you can simply see where the tracks are)."
142,"Updated review: I have used this app for half a year, against my better judgement."
143,This is simply the most bugged piece of software I have ever used.
144,"The game loads slowly, and doesn't work without an internet connection."
145,"Some of the bugs I've experienced: Reminders pop up on random days, no matter how many times I readjust their settings."
146,"Visual bugs: shows one item, but you get some other item."
147,Doesn't post a new blog if I clear the 'uploading...' notification The new blog posting process is somehow interrupted and doesn't finish completely if I clear the 'uploading...' notification.
148,"Next, if I open the app again, it doesn't show any indication of the ongoing process which doesn't give me any kind of update (of whether the new blog got completely/half way uploaded/or cancelled)."
149,"Go ahead and try it,  use the evernote clipper on a PC to save a Bookmark to whatever page on the Web you like,  then open the newly created note on an Android device, you can't edit properly because the note contains unsupported formating."
150,Syncing is one of the best  features.
151,"To get full use, use more tags and less notebooks."
152,"If I use evernote across all of my devices (the only reason I use it) it constantly happens that an older version of a note on one device will sync as the most recent version, even though that device hasn't been synced in days."
153,"If I have it on my computer and I didn't close it out and my computer is in sleep mode for a weekend and I've been using it on my phone throughout the weekend and I return to the computer and wake it up, that version of the notes syncs up and screws me out of the entire weekend's worth of data and updates."
154,What kind of idiot programming allows it to think a note that hasn't been updated in two days on one device should override a note that has been constant use on another device.
155,"But now from last two updates Evernote has disappointed me again and again because whenever I share and save a note, it's(note's) view is totally compromised."
156,Now I'm searching for another app which can save my data as it is available like the previous versions of Evernote used to do.
157,The update to the new format has made this app practically unusable.
158,"Now that the overlay widget is gone and you're taken into the app itself, it's much less functional and shows off all your other saved notes at the same time."
159,It's worse sorry Since the last update I can't use my regular photo viewer to choose pictures from my post.
160,"I have around 30,000 images in various picture folders (I am travelling and have a 128GB sd card in my tablet where my images are stored)  and this update to 3.9 has made choosing images impossible."
161,Either I upload the images to google or similar and put a link in the post to them.
162,Or my second option is to upload the images in the WordPress app through the media menu item and then choose these images I want in the post using your new chooser interface.
163,Updating posts on tablets and phones has been great with the WordPress app and I feel it's just been made more difficult with this update.
164,Lots of room to improve - The bullet point feature is buggy - The offline feature is buggy - Does not offer start screen customization.
165,"It always open with all notes in a flat view  - No password protection per folder,  only for the whole app - Pictures are not attached in line so that you can comment on them and in context with the rest of the note - No font customization - No manual notebook sorting  - No default view/sort option per folder,  only for the whole app - No ability to include notes with tables."
166,I can still never find a way to use the settings and change my default notebook when sharing from browsers or create a new note.
167,"Great viewer, horrible editor While viewing functionality and searching is on par with the Evernote desktop app, the Android app is riddled with editing problems, like (1) deletes spaces between words when you open for editing, (2) ""HTML"" notes with font family/size changes, justification, rules can only be edited ONE LINE at a time, (3) bold, underline, italics randomly activate or won't turn off/on, (4) navigation with Dpad or keyboard arrows is buggy, skipping lines, not wrapping, etc."
168,It would help to separate work/personal etc notes and would simplify searching by tags when one has many.
169,"Each time the app is updated, it decides to fill up the internal phone storage, rather than the the SD card."
170,"And following an app update, you then MUST re-download ALL previously downloaded apps, and again, fill up the phone storage not the SD."
171,"This app is getting very tiresome to use - weekly updates, repeatedly having to download all previous map files after every app update, frequent nag screens."
172,"It shows up as installed in my app settings, but evernote's icon is no where to be found nor is there a widget like before."
173,"Tonnes of fluff, but lacks some basic stuff... ... like the ability to delete a note, which has been requested for a bloody long time."
174,"In what universe does this ""feature"" count as an ""option"" that should be lower on the priority list of things to implement than things like... location tagging?"
175,"Syncs notes so I can share them between home, work and my phone."
176,"I use Evernote pretty heavily, and it does what I need it to, but it also has a few annoying problems."
177,"The rich text formatting also occasionally bugs out completely, especially on a note with lots of formatting, and sometimes the only way to fix it is to remove the formatting and add it all back manually."
178,"The new ""Context"" feature is intrusive and keeps trying to turn itself back on after updates."
179,The movable curve for setting time and wheel for setting date is not working and imo is totally redundant.
180,"But when i select ""set location"", the app automatically search and pin my CURRENT location and worst, it uses the TITLE of the note as the name of my CURRENT location."
181,"If I hatch a new pet or try to make a new change to my avatar it can sometimes take several minutes for the app to recognize and show the change, meanwhile I'm trying to figure out what I did wrong."
182,Absolutely appalled - had to clear the data and cache associated with the gallery and restart phone - have deleted Evernote and won't be using it no matter how useful it could be.
183,How dare an app be set up to arbitarily change settings on other apps without informing the user and giving them the choice not to do it!
184,"Shared notes do not generate Evernote or email notification to recipient, even though recipient receives emails from others and spam folder is empty."
185,"However, after yesterday's update, the only way to share notes today (11/04/2016) is by sending them as regular text emails, not Evernote link."
186,"Pop up message indicated I had a bad connection to the internet, however I was successfully connected to WiFi."
187,"Seems like it would be great, but it's a bit clunky & makes my phone freeze I was really excited about this app, I wish it worked better on my phone (Moto X 2nd Gen/ And."
188,"Was trying to use EN to put together a rough idea for a photo book:  -When taking pics of handwritten notes either in Post-It or document format, they came out in varying positions; sideways, upside-down, etc."
189,-Sometimes pics wouldn't transfer into a notebook once captured  After a half hour of trying to make it work right I just hung it up.
190,I click the link and go through the steps and it loops me back to sending an email.
191,"So so Decent app, but laking some basic options: font size, font type, alignment (justified), background color, possibility to add a new note to a new notebook when editing it (you can save it only to an existing notebook and move it to the desired notebook after you get out and create it) password protection is a paid option."
192,The sync works fast and without problems.
193,Android app still lacks many features the Windows PC version supports.
194,"Most features that aren't supported I have to refuse to use because I can't make my notes look how I want, or if I edit on Android a note made with formatting on Windows it will royally !screw!"
195,2000 words of hard work gone.
196,This app was the best app on my device since last 30 months uptil last update in Dec. 18.
197,But those dev have made changes n kept lower end devices compatibility with new features also.
198,And for forcing me to be connected to the internet it doesn't even notify me of new posts from my guilds and party.
199,Update 1/4/20: the app is no longer working after you try to create a new note and add one word of text.
200,Update February 2020: app still isn't working correctly even after reinstalling again.
201,I have since removed from my phone and looking for another note app option.
202,"great features BUT ... i love the features (great widget, compatibility with Skitch etc) - they're great for my Note II, and make for a great SNote (app) replacement  BUT - there are some issues."
203,"my number one problem is the lack of accessibility - can't batch delete notes, not to mention it's cumbersome still to delete them one by one (open...menu...scroll down... delete)."
204,"the only way i can move my cursor to edit text is by using the arrows built into my Swype keyboard, which is inadequate for long notes  i wish i could like this app, so i hope these issues get looked into... :)"
205,"EDIT: I haven't transferred everything to OneNote so I still use Evernote to view some notes but (1) and (2) haven't been resolved, and I'm not sure about (3) because I no longer edit notes or create new notes using the app."
206,"(1) If I'm not using the default font, icons just show up as random letters, I wouldn't know what I was tapping if I wasn't using it before, (2) My notes look chaotic, font sizes vary throughout the note even when everything's in default and (3) I've never had problems with my keyboard using different apps but typing in Evernote was so frustrating."
207,"Useful, but slow Evernote allows you to enter notes from a computer, smartphone or tablet, and even by email, and access it from any device with an Internet connection."
208,Awesome just wish the free version allowed connection to more than two devices.
209,I have the same typing/editing issues as everyone else since the new update.
210,"I can forgive almost all the other quirks except the fact that when I type a word (and Evernote causes my keyboard to get it wrong) and I backspace, it doesn't delete the entire word, and I have to go thru and delete the entire word manually, no matter what long, nonsensical word Evernote has decided to put in for me."
211,"New bug When creating a new text note, the options pane on the bottom is missing, not allowing me to change to bold, underline, add checklists, bullet points, etc."
212,"This may have something to do with my keyboard auto-loading when I try to make a new note, as it does not when I go the ""Start a new..."" route."
213,"Gallery creation/modification missing, Nexus 4 video upload doesn't work	On the whole, the UI is clear and nicely built, but two basics things I use most are missing/not working: - Creating a gallery necessitates first googling the workaround in their support forums (i.e."
214,"(1) attach multiple photos, (2) save as draft; this uploads images and links them to this post, (3) edit post replacing all code with just [gallery]; this uses all linked images (4) publish) - editing a gallery is impossible (just recreate using workaround) - uploading videos on my device doesn't work (invalid file type error), nor does the ""quick video"" function (can not retrieve media)"
215,"So hears my review While sharing something to evernote, I have to click this and then that just to select which notebook I want to save it to otherwise it automatically saves into the wrong notebook."
216,"Also while saving my recipes, half of the ones do not show its picture and there is no option of deleting the picture and manually adding one for myself ."
217,One of the main reasons I used Evernote was to create lists for myself and display them on my home screen so I would not forget or ignore the tasks I set myself throughout the day.
218,"I tried send a file from (Google keep) to evernote, every file if content : yahoo or Google and login or password these kind of words, will be changed to yahoo online news or advertising in my evernote , it's really make me worry about this app it's safe to save my files ??!!"
219,"Here's what's lacking for me: When I'm in a lecture class that I would like to record, the record function only works if I do not use any other insertable feature such as taking a picture or drawing a diagram."
220,"The most frustrating feature missing for me right now is the ability to change the default view in the computer based app, it always defaults to ""Created"" (date) and ""Revers Sort Order"", I do not think that way; I need to specify my preferred view (""Notes by Title"" Ascending)."
221,"Would love to be able to see PDFs in-line in my notes and viewable full screen, without having to download the PDF and open in another app (which often creates another copy of the PDF file)."
222,10/13/15 UPDATE-- Now BAR widget is gone from my tablet screen.
223,And why do you have to perform 2 steps to get note to appear on homescreen?
224,Used to be able to set reminder from inside note when creating note.
225,"Error when uploading imagen to post.WordPress Android version: 4.5.2 Android device name: LGE Nexus 5  01 - Configuring Simperium 02 - Already registered for GCM 03 - resetting suggestion tables 04 - reader post list &gt; restoring instance state 05 - reader post list &gt; creating post adapter 06 - reader post list &gt; purging database 07 - reader post list &gt; updating current user 08 - reader post list &gt; updating tags and blogs 09 - trackLastActivity, activityId: My Site 10 -"
226,"I have used this app from the beginning, and I have been through all the bugs and fixes."
227,"Hit the data limit and needed to upgrade, and was given no option to do so - the mobile app loads a blank screen, the desktop app loads a web page, and the web page tells me in fine print to go dig through my settings in Apple Music (which I never use)."
228,Useful App This is a useful app especially because I am able to upload my notes from my Write  Scribe pen directly into Evernote.
229,"Use to be if u typed something in ur note & used the back button, it would save whatever u wrote AUTOMATICALLY & BEFORE going back to the main menu."
230,"Since the last 2-3 updates however, one has to physically hit the done button to save ur wrk."
231,"Now you need an additional step, click on the edit (pen) button at the bottom right."
232,Y unnecessarily add steps when they are NOT NEEDED :(
233,"Becomes extremely slow as file grows I keep adding to a couple of notes I use to list various activities I do, and as soon as a file is longer than a couple of pages it becomes frustratingly slow to edit."
234,"I once rated the app 5 star for all the incredible features, but now the simplest task of all, writing lines of text with the date and names of events I've recently attended, has become a near impossible one to complete."
235,"Actually the old ones don't get unsaved (when I view them on browser, then choose ""View in Reader"", the posts are still marked as ""Saved"") but they are not displayed in Saved posts so I can't access them offline (which is the reason I use the save function)."
236,"And when visiting someone's blog, I prefer seeing an outline of their posts, which can help me access ANY post of that person, over an incomplete list of posts sorted chronically which doesn't display all of their posts (some of them are only accessible on the app through browser, so what's the point of using the app over browser?)"
237,I like the app but wonder sometimes why WordPress suggests that I share posts on social media to increase views when I have done so to several sites the day before and had multiple comments and likes on those sites but WP shows me having less than one-third as many views or worse.
238,"First one, I started a post, and I wanted to save it, so I pressed the arrow in the up corner to acces next options, but that icon is a ""paper airplane"" that publish the post without even ask!"
239,"I search for something like post adjustments (oh, they were in the footer!"
240,"Worst than that, I continued editing it, and the next time I accessed it, a message appeared, something like ""the post is not updated, do you want to?"""
241,"and I thought of course, upload the changes, but what it did was download the first draft (the published one) overwriting the last one so I completely lost ALL of my work."
242,"On top of all that, I searched the internet for help, and the only possible solution needed my device rooted before all this, and search some hidden directories, but it comes to happen that there are lots of people who doesn't even know what is to root an android device."
243,"I should have chosen to use Google Keep which came naturally installed app on my phone but I didn't like that everything was based on Google, also same thing with my photos, non-existent music player and some other stuff we're based on Google too meaning no gallery app (blue and yellow flower icon) and had to download VLC as a music player making me feel like I was lacking basic essentials from my phone apps."
244,"I wish it could just do a small box over the existing screen, where you could select your options like tags and notebook, without changing the active app."
245,"I used Evernote for all my notes, but pretty much disabled the other functions."
246,"I installed the Metro version of the app on my Windows 10 PC, not knowing their was a legacy version of Evernote."
247,"Even after uninstalling the Metro version with a registry clean, the legacy version refused to install claiming only one version was allowed per user."
248,Even working with Evernote tech support (who spent a lot of time assisting me) the problem couldn't be resolved.
249,I rely on this app for everything and now I can't use it for its most important feature to me!
250,Then there's the fact of trying to delete check boxes and other formatting options.
251,it deleted all my notes and told me that it no longer uses notepad and used this app instead.
252,"Words following a checkbox for some reason do not work with my keyboard auto suggest, meaning I have to spell each word correctly on this little mobile keyboard."
253,"Suffice to say that just before I started typing this, I fired a message from a reserve Evernote account (opened solely for this purpose) to the main one via Work Chat."
254,"The PC version seems more reliable on this regard, but nevertheless Evernote is not very reliable and cannot handle version control especially when the note is shared."
255,"Thus you keep getting Conflicting changes,and when someone tells you he has finished editing the note, the final version does not reflect immediately, so there's always a pang of doubt as to whether you are reading the right one."
256,Untrustworthy for work purposes and right now I use it mostly because my boss does.
257,"If I do find what I'm looking for, I can't edit at that location, as soon as I hit the edit button (why you'd need a button to edit a note when thats basically all this program is for is beyond me), it takes me back to the top of the note."
258,also: CRASHES CONSTANTLY WHEN GOING TO SETTINGS.
259,"It's really hard to get a good snapshot of your notes as a whole and how they're organized, or to move around between notes by navigating rather than searching."
260,"There's no warning message if you close a note without saving it, so it's really easy to lose your work."
261,"Same is true if a refresh or save fails for some reason: the message appears only briefly, so if you miss it you can keep plugging away at notes that you'll never be able to save."
262,So you have to delete the photo from the post and leave it as the featured image for the post to look normal and not retarded.
263,"Just looking for an explanation why you'd need my exact location, contact list info, test access to protected storage, and especially the read your contacts and read call log bit."
264,Is there a way to disable these features and what logic is behind you needing access to my contact and call log information for making note taking easier?
265,"Lost several large, detailed notes over the past year or more, help and support steps do not work (searching the trash, sending an activity log, can't email without subscription, etc.)."
266,"It says it's due to too many devices connected and to upgrade to the pro version, I have and only ever have had one device connected which it shows in the settings."
267,Such a shame but just not worth risking using as I have lost important information without any option to retrieve it.
268,"1-You cannot upload on the featured image button, you have to do that on the main screen of the site."
269,"2-You cannot get the edit post link through the app, have to log into dashboard on a browser."
270,I need these links to submit post to my editor through Slack or Trello.
271,"I tried downloading evernote on my computer but can't start it (just in the browser, and can't play the audio files there anyway) and just encountered more useless problems that I have no idea how to fix..."
272,"very buggy Using Verizon Samsung Note 3  tags created on android app do not sync to web app  edit note title - no way to save without editing note body as well  Web app (unrelated, I know) does not have pop-up descriptions for all buttons  Overall experience of Evernote is this: looks exciting, I like the whole idea, but easily the buggiest software system I've seen in years."
273,Misses lots of posts ..
274,The latest version's reader seems to miss random posts .. and only shows a handful of posts ..
275,"I would have to check my email notifications, read the posts there, and if I need to comment I would need to go look for it .. very annoying and undermines the main purpose I installed the application for .."
276,The hotels that I've booked cannot be found using the search function.
277,I supposed you would need to enter the hotel name in Japanese in order for the search to work.
278,Google map works wonder using English.
279,"Even without using the search function, the Osaka map is difficult to read (compared to Google Map) as it is mostly in Japanese."
280,Update:  Found solution and more I wanted to download and sync Outlook notes to my Fascinate.
281,Update:  Evernote seems to have stopped working on my Android.
282,"In Edit Note I need these Options , Kindly solve my issue 😠 When I save a txt note and then I try to edit it , the font change its color to white and get disappeared , then no matter what to do but the Note get clear."
283,"❌please give us options like you have given in iPhone📱(iOS), ⚫Options in iOS are  ✔Share ✔Present ✔Add Shortcut ✔Duplicate ✔Simplify Formatting ✔Delete ✔Cancel ..."
284,I need these option in editing a note the most important option is❕Simply Formatting.
285,The first mentioned problem is solvable with this option.
286,This app is way to complicated and every task I try presents a new set of tasks that can't be completed in order to complete the first task!
287,"I used Evernote years ago and loved it,now I feel like I need a master's degree to navigate and make it work."
288,"Google Play Services has Stopped Every time I open this app, my Note 4 heats up and lags until I get a message saying Google play services has crashed."
289,"There's no simple way to center the canvas on screen, the arrows continually get in the way, and the zooming/scrolling never seems to work on the first try, preferring to detect only one finger and leave a giant streak in the note."
290,"Last of all, please stop pushing Evernote ads into my device's notification menu."
291,And on few occasions the App version threw off main version from Laptop.
292,"Too many bugs Ecoing another user, the maps themselves are nice after they finally download."
293,I can't get miles to work as the setting defaults back to kilometers every time.
294,"I wanted to use it offline and without using my location (to save battery), but the app constantly prompted me to switch on location."
295,"There's a bug in the bookmark view, it's difficult to edit the bookmark for items with a lot of details, it will snap to the bottom or top, and the ""edit"" button is in the middle."
296,GPS Bug updated.
297,No voice Nav and regular google maps is much less of a battery drain  GPS bug is as follows.
298,"You can search for a location, but if your GPS wasn't already enabled it will constantly search never making a connection."
299,You have to stop the app restart it with GPS already enabled and it seems to work for the most part but it was very spotty and it makes it extremely hard to use if you don't have time to stop and park and occasionally I had to hit the lower left button to make it connect again if it stopped working.
300,"Taking notes on whatever device and sync them with all my other devices, is why I started using evernote."
301,"I'm a long-time premium Evernote user, but this new update is baffling."
302,I like the consistent interface between devices and getting rid of features that added little to the user experience.
303,"Great app based on features, AWFUL due to bugs!"
304,"Still using it daily, after restarting it several times, but the bugs are a huge drawback!"
305,"Will change the review once I will be able to rearrange the tasks without having them moved back were they  were (or placed somewhere in-between), when it wouldn't crash when I set a notification on a task, when the party tabs don't appear on tasks view, and when the animals appear in the app when they are found, not hours later (refresh + app restart = no use in this case)."
306,"I may have accidentally pressed a key to delete everything, but no undo button was available."
307,Extremely frustrating to loose hours and hours of work.
308,My older phone (Note Fe) using older version don't have this problem.
309,"With each new version, you kept on removing functions and crippling the app."
310,Updated Feb 2020: what is wrong with Evernote?
311,"Still freezes, note reopens while reading, crashes."
312,Updated Dec 2017: crashes repeatedly all day long since app update end of Nov on Samsung s8.
313,Previous review: Brilliant sync features between multiple devices.
314,"Free Evernote account was great on devices, then on Google enabled Nokia smartphone became so slow unable to use (even tho' using SD card)."
315,"**I do not recommend a buy on this app' but stick with the free version as the  major difference is the ability to search on this one, but it is not good and you essentially have the same features on both, free & Pro, with out it."
316,"MapWithMe Pro has a nice mapping interface it works great on my 7.0, but *The app doesn't do navigation or street address search but merely shows you as a dot on a map which is the same as the free version."
317,*The search feature add to the Pro version is very limited: not worth the money.
318,"* The Samsung 7.0 comes with, Latitude, for free and gives you the ability to download maps for offline uses and work just as good."
319,"Also, by browsing forums I realised that a lot of small, basic features, such as different marker colours, are missing."
320,"Update: It turns out that EN has more issues that I thought - for example, desynchronised formatting between Web and desktop versions or a chance for a note's content to disappear."
321,"In the avatar creation, I had to keep pressing the options I wanted over and over for it to actually work, then when I finished the avatar had options I didn't pick."
322,"Adding tags is really clunky because the tags have to be added to the filter, (I guess it works but it's unintuitive to have to add a tag to the filter instead of just tagging the task itself) but when I add them they don't immediately get added."
323,"Sometimes swiping doesn't work, sometimes trading the icon doesn't work."
324,"With patience all this stuff does eventually work, but it's tedious to just use the app."
325,--> Cannot save whole Internet pages - it saves only URLs when I use the share feature in my browser.
326,I was just traveling without internet and was pleased I could update my offline lists to account for changes I didn't think of before my trip.
327,But ultimately - I have been using this on my laptop/phone/tablet/and work PC.
328,"Not  useful for sharing between PC and Android Evernote is good for keeping notes on an Android device, but what I needed was an application with which I could easily edit notes on my Android devices and on my PC at work."
329,There is no option to remove the unsupported formatting.
330,"Tile view is gone (easier on my older eyes), editing a list is more obtuse (What You See is no longer What You Get until you exit edit mode), some functions now buried in hidden menus, and cloud printing from tablet no longer works."
331,"Great features, easy to use, but it has ONE MAJOR BUG that has been there for 2 years - they sometimes solve it, most of the time they mess it up."
332,"Sometimes an update would relocate your maps to the phone, sometimes it would delete all maps, sometimes you had to uninstall and reinstall, sometimes ...."
333,"(for Android devices)     If you want to store downloaded maps on SD, you should move them directly from the app – open app’s settings > Map > Maps storage > select SD card."
334,"If you don’t see Maps storage tab in app’s settings, turn off the device, take out SD card and put it back again, turn on the device."
335,New user interface sucks I am paying Evernote user and I must tell you: new user experience sucks.
336,"Stopped working on 1/25/2016 Just lost last few days of notes on my offline Android device, and unable to add new notes."
337,"Evernote has completely lost my trust - how can you not keep a local cache of data, and not even show an error message when the sync fails?!"
338,"Password needs improvement in lock time, and you must add a lock button at the menu options."
339,Apart from it there is a persistent bug with search.
340,"After multiple updated over the years, Evernote definitely is a lot more polished and feature rich than it used to be."
341,"Continuous upsell of ""Upgrade you subscription"" type messages in push notification and in-app promos daily are starting to really bug me."
342,"Ok so when I use Google Keep I have my top 3 notes pinned, so don't have to look through app to find them, I open the Keep app and they are literally right there every single time, I mainly use this feature for my daily to do lists so I don't have to look for it every single time."
343,I really want to completely leave Keep for Evernote however the lack of this feature may be a deal breaker for me.
344,"I use the PC applications and for some reasons it hangs (long waits, not necessary crash)."
345,"I appreciate the technical complexity in the Evernote - for 100,000 notes I use there were 7 un sync able - and most of them were out of strange fonts when using the samsung pad written module , which i can understand."
346,Alternative for reading evernote is the online login - don't every say its not useful - to search and read back.
347,I was so embarassed when i showed a colleague how to use the evernote chat but it turns out i never received the shared page.
348,"After a successful sync confirmation the screen still shows the previous sync timestamp for a while,  a situation that could trigger the user to change data at the wrong time."
349,Some messages are needed to advise the user when syncing is in progress because it takes several minutes leading to problem
350,This app needs work.
351,Missing key features Been using this app for a few years and it is still lacking two significant features:  1.
352,- Car navigation is so bad it's practically useless  PROS: - Good offline map support for when you visit countries where you have no service so long as you do not need navigation - Maps include hiking trails which is very useful if you're hiking national parks and you want to check where you are on the trail.
353,"If you want to use Evernote for its high level features and are willing to pay for it, then you'll probably like it."
354,"However, don't expect a widget because they inexplicably removed it, to the disappointment of many of their users."
355,"It's clearly an attempt to force people into the premium plan at $8/month, which is just too much for those of us that just want the features in the basic plan but with more than one device, and they continue to not offer a lower priced plan that many would probably adopt just to have more devices."
356,Plus this password reset thing made me not only change my password once but create a new one on every desktop and phone tablet because of how update was tooled.
357,"If I wanted to keep using evernote, I would have had to create 5 new passwords and then after 5th, go back to other 4 and set sync pwd to whatever last device had."
358,"I've since moved on to OI Notepad: basic but allows tags, works with OI File Manager, writes to SD, and needs no internet rights."
359,Used to be great One of the recent updates broke the check box function.
360,"Evernote, you better get you act together and send an update to fix these problems."
361,"Slowly but surely Evernote has been removing features from the free version (presentation mode, offline notebooks, etc), so it should really come as no surprise that they've sunk to the new low of making the free version essentially a ""trial version""; only allowing two devices when their mantra all along has been ""Sync your notes across all of your devices""."
362,"Very poor on nexus 5 App works very crappy on nexus   Fails to provide the most essential part.. Intuitive editing of notes..   Notes jump continuously back to top, can't be edited at all, app hangs, favorite's can't be accessed because the scroll bar gets in the way 9 out of 10 times..  Was happy and intensive  user - but currently can't use it decently on mobile device  Evernote .. Get your act together please"
363,"Recently, even after update, my notes get locked and kept having a message, ""This note is a text-only."
364,The newest updates still had bug.
365,"Since Evernote update version 8.2 above, cannot send/share image through Whatsapp, and cannot open the image sent ."
366,(Open note that have picture file > select image > tap share button > choose Whatsapp > select contact > send > tap the file send > sender & receiver can't see the image files) On 8.1 version all works fine.
367,"DEC 2020 REVIEW: New version crashes when I try to take a photo with the app or try to attach a document and won't save any notes I write in my phone, even text notes."
368,Please change the mobile app back to the old version until you're sure everything works.
369,"I also really appreciated the tables functionality of the Mac version but this hasn't even got the option to make a table, let alone edit it."
370,At the moment I'm getting by with the web version of Evernote when I'm using my Pixelbook but I really don't want to be
371,"I have used evernote for a while now and may continue to use it, but unfortunately it seems that every update for Android comes with new bugs."
372,"This time (June 5 update) a synching error message keeps on appearing, upon which the app suggests to ""see the original note""."
373,"UPDATE Thu May 23 2019: Sadly, downgradin from 3 to 2 stars."
374,"Logical Layout Needs Great Widget Important sync abilities allows  information to flow across multiple devices is great,  but who can't do that these days?"
375,This feature actually is extremely useful and Evernote keeps it rather simple.
376,"I currently use the app on my tablet, my desktop, and my phone (all non-iOs) but what I have been finding is that when you make an edit on two devices before a sync occurs on either device, files get stored and when the syn finally occurs, they essentially crash."
377,The recent update (v 10.4.4 build 458403 public; Editor: v112.1.14477; Service: v1.23.6) completely ruined what used to be a great app.
378,Inability to load notes when there is no internet connection if they had been updated (and there is no setting to turn on local storage) makes the app completely unreliable.
379,"Mobile doesn't work When trying to edit a note on the mobile app for Samsung galaxy 3, all of the text is blanked out."
380,Showing new job applications when I'm just trying to show my bosses some new protocols.
381,I do like the addition of searching for posts via keywords & hope that stays.
382,"The undo/redo feature frequently will not work ... you can get into a situation where it ""forgets"" what's in the clipboard and your previous version of the document."
383,"To list but a few, the 2 device limit now,  Bugs not being fixed, always had trouble with PC version not saving changes, and recently it will put loads of extra blank lines in my notes for NO REASON!"
384,Please do the needful since the note is locked I am unable to do anything against it Emailing is also not helpful as they directly mentioned they do not respond to the email and have provided some sort of training links for Evernote.
385,Bring back the old Evernote please or bring back those missing features: widget + quick note access from notifications menu.
386,"Speed is still an issue for those functions which have always been there: new note, search (especially within large notes of text) and camera access within a note."
387,"A significant backward step Now there is no way to select which maps to update, nor is there any indication of download size (why not?)."
388,The option to download WITHOUT routing has disappeared.
389,I will not be updating my phone to v6 as this is the device I use most.
390,Tried updating one small map (Guernsey 449kB) and found ALL my old maps had been deleted.
391,"Doesn't upload and deletes posts It will upload small posts with no pictures in them, but as soon as I attempt to upload a longer post with photos it starts a never ending upload which never actually finishes."
392,Then when you go back into the app to see what is going on it deletes the post you were trying to upload and you are left with only the title and the knowledge that you have entirely wasted your time and need to write the whole thing and locate all the media files again.
393,"Unfortunately, I need to keep using one note in  order for me to be able to utilize my notes the way I need."
394,"I though maybe  trying the premium version would allow us this option, but sadly, no."
395,A work around is to manually forcing syncs between changes.
396,"New version has bugs Editing now is almost completely useless :( also have no idea why some bullets get removed sometimes when editing as well as when i scroll down in a note and point my finger to edit some text, it brings me back to the top, also goes from view to edit mode sometimes for no reason i can see."
397,"New Device Limit Feedback If you're going to lock us out of a 3rd device, which may be our Mobile App, at least give us access to Manage Devices in the mobile app!"
398,"The sharing features are useful, but accessing them is not intuitive and I tire of digging through notebooks and chats to find information shared with me."
399,I have upgraded to premium to use the most out of Evernote and use it with it's full features.
400,However annotating PDF works poorly especially since it creates on my disk or Adobe storage new pdf after every single edit!
401,I have published a blog post one week ago on my computer and today I  decided to start writing a new post on the mobile app.
402,"When I clicked on it the draft from one month ago opened, the post without  any pictures and half of the text missing."
403,The app  is not refreshing and updating the posts that are already published so I  will not use it anymore.
404,"Ok for simple text but shear horror if you want to upload images.Upload is interrupted most of the time leaves the local media cache completely broken.No easy upload of multiple images (workaround via filemanager share dialog), no progress bar on upload (no idea if finished, incomplete or still working).Crashes if accidentally refresh media library during upload."
405,Last 2 updates made the formating menu useless while editing on a galaxy tab s2.
406,Use pc and mac and android versions to have stuff always around.
407,I also like the fact that you can download the app to any device and log in and change or edit your note in real time!
408,Strange defects and incapacities I was able to post immediately with simple text updates immediately.
409,"POSTS ARE NOT POSTING, PICTURES ARE NOT UPLOADING, PEOPLE ARE NOT ABLE TO VIEW POSTS."
410,I've used WordPress for years but your new step forward is amazing.
411,PLEASE ADD 'SHARE' OPTION IN SITE PAGES SO THAT WE COULD SHARE LINKS OF OUR INDIVIDUAL SITE PAGES FROM THE APP FOR THOSE OF US MANAGING MULTIPLE PAGES IN ONE WEBSITE.
412,"My last point is about the email option, When I send a piece of work to my email address, the note appears in the email and not as a document attachment."
413,"Needs web clipping function This is handy for reading notes created on the desktop version or creating new text notes, pictures, etc., but if you are using any browser besides Dolphin the web clipping function clips the HTML address for a page and not the actual page."
414,"EDIT 2 phone corrupts old notes when editing & I Can't sync or delete them EDIT: on new desktop app, caps lock disables control commands (ctrl+b bold etc) I have used & loved free & paid evernote versions."
415,"I used to be able email links to my Notes using the Share option to open my work or personal email apps, then email the Share URL.The share option now channels through Evernote messages."
416,Android version needs work No undo.
417,Edit mode needs to support phone numbers and links like Gnotes.
418,"too many updates and some minor annoyances good solid app,  but too many updates all the time."
419,"Plus,  some of the UI needs works."
420,"Though, locating a specific post is tricky and time consuming (unless it's a recent post)."
421,I wanted to leave a comment about a problem I keep having editing notes (when entering a new line in a note the following line loses it's word spacing bunching all the words together) however there appears to be no way to contact anyone at Evernote.
422,"Every option for contact leads you to ""Make a ticket"" with no option to make this ticket (whatever that is)."
423,BTW the app works great other than that one small problem - oh and the lack of support.
424,"Please provide a restricted version with fewer permissions ""Evernote Private"", without the privacy issues and albeit, less functionality."
425,Story goes like this: Almost all the working days I used to add important information in Evernote.
426,"I got a pop up message @ 5pm, showing that Evernote cannot sync the latest update."
427,"Loaded app to my new phone, tried to log in-didn't work."
428,"Reset password again, tried logging in AGAIN, still didn't work."
429,"Last week I logged in and was forced to use one of 3 times to sign out a suspicious iPhone (I have never used an iPhone) so I added security to my account, including password."
430,Today I tried logging in and I have another mysterious device log in.
431,There is no option in settings to change the location of maps to SD card.
432,"Leaving screen with download progress shown resets download from say 50 % to 0%, meaning you cannot use your phone during maps downloading process untill it completely finished."
433,"I am using wp but when I trying to edit previous post,option shows but not edit another problem is setting, view site,user options not working  and site stats shows too late please upgrade it's suddenly."
434,"Having used the app for a little while now, I'd like to see more work put into it."
435,"For instance, I'd like to have the option of disabling the local storage of notes on my phone."
436,"I'd also like to see the incorporation of a simple To-do list add-on that works similarly to Wunderlist, with reminders and quick simple text entries."
437,"I understand that there are more security features and the ability to edit shared notes with the premium account, but this is not worth anything near $45 per annum."
438,"No Android Love I like evernote wanted to love it,but compared to windows and mac version it doesn't compare, give android users some love, let us change the view setting, give us the same tool options, and it would be nice if there was a spell check and color coding options on the tags or notebooks, why are you guys so afraid of  color!"
439,"needs a sync option, and more features on the widget."
440,it uses data and slow the app in place with slow internet.
441,"needs an option to sync every week, more like offline app."
442,Edits from other devices may not show immediately.
443,"When I try to add the Evernote List widget it gives me the following error ""Problem loading widget""."
444,"It only happens with this specific one, if I try to add the Evernote Action Bar works fine."
445,The most unbearable problem so far is the poor searching function: tried to find a certain address but the map can not actively find the exact location and re-center the map to the target location.
446,"My cell phone is LG G3, Android 4.4.2, had already loaded with the maps used for address searching."
447,"The app lacks easy linking to already published posts, a way to copy a previous post, and the mouse support on Android is terrible - formatting buttons and most dialog boxes don't respond to mouse clicks at all."
448,"Slow rendering of maps, poor info and bad navigation of pois, but most importantly it drains ur device battery!!!"
449,"This latest version changed my default map location from SD card to main memory, then told me I didn't have enough memory to update my maps, although this version only updates changes."
450,"Previous version (on my Android phone) wouldn't let me access my Notifications, so I just updated the app, hoping this would help."
451,"UPDATE: After a ""response"" and multiple uninstalls, reinstalls & updates, same problem is still there."
452,"From not being able to upload photos, to my site being hidden when it's quite blatantly not, and not being able to start a new post, oy being able go into setting for about 5 seconds be for it puts me back to the main menu."
453,Thought this was a simple way to easily create a blog but it wouldn't let me have the same username/blog/url name so I attempted to delete but apparently that isn't an option.
454,"Followed all the steps to change my email, that won't work either."
455,"The help is  outdated giving you wrong indications, making you loose a lot of time."
456,"I've  shared one of my many lists via Wi-Fi direct between my devices, but it's  archived and there is no option to import."
457,Update UI issues The UI faces some tremendous update glitches when I try to set big Dailies or To-Dos with lots of checklist items and lots of reminders.
458,Also the reminders feature though nice to have - they need major refinement.
459,I hope you update this point; 1) coz I read many reviews in Google that users are asking for it.
460,"I downgraded to a much older version and saw an error message where it hangs: ""Note edit error: Android system is updating."
461,That is why the new version gets frozen without any explanation.
462,A suggestion would be to have a online search function (like MapFactor's google search) to be able to find those items and be able to translate the info into an offline nav point.
463,I used settings to download the maps to my external SD card.
464,Tried to uninstall/install several times and still does not work correctly.
465,More stars when this major feature is working correctly.
466,I have a  workbook for notes taken during each work Sprint ... half the time i dont  care to see all my notes .. this is bad UX and only good for prople that  aren't using Evernote correctly.
467,"Toolbar Change -1 What happened to the ""save"" option on the tool bar after the latest update?!?!"
468,"I am using wp but when I trying to edit previous post,option shows but not edit another problem is setting, view site,user options not working  and site stats shows too late please upgrade it's suddenly."
469,"Doesn't search by postcode, the three locations I tried came up with no  results (the locations have been there for over 20 years), then when you  search for the actual road names and find them, the area it lists them in  is usually wrong, so you'd have to really know where you were heading  before you trusted it."
470,"The app also seems to only give you one route  choice, no option to change to quickest or shortest in the settings, or  avoid motorways etc."
471,Nearly no function worked properly.
472,The app updated older versions of post drafts so that the recent progress was deleted.
473,"The mobile bowser version works fine, while the app is causing more problems than is solves."
474,"Then I can't save the username and display name I create, and the avatar generator screen doesn't load any options."
475,"Very unstable on Asus Tablet Adding photos via the camera very often crashes the app, which then of course loses everything you've written."
476,"Also, adding photos does work, and it lets you set alignment, but it doesn't seem to be able to properly type text to flow around those images, so using Alignment None is really the only option."
477,"As a cyclist I have to say that this is the only app so far that I have checked that allows you to create routes using small roads that doesn't crash or fails for some random reason or has them all removed; google maps, strava, osmand, bike citizen, here we go, sygic maps, all of them failed spectacularly, this one did not."
478,"However the real problem is that I am unable to create anything but short routes due to the limitations in the amount of stops that I can add; given there are tons of forest roads you can never pick the one you like and make something longer than 30km of a route; It also isn't even a paid feature, I'd have paid for such feature in a heartbeat."
479,"Back to square one having to buy a GPS, and these garmins aren't cheap at all; I am however pleased on how close this was to actually work, that I dared to write this review; hoping they implement it, even if it's paid; maybe they can have competition in something they never expected to."
480,"Adds have been added in one of the never versions, don't update if you haven't already!"
481,"It works best if you find your destination address with a browser, as the names in OSM don't always match."
482,"Due to size limits, searching by street numbers is not possible and this severely limits your options."
483,Settings don't save Incredibly annoying that my KM to Miles & hide zoom settings get reset as soon as I make a search.
484,Decided to try Evernote using the Springpad export feature (Evernote waived the file size limit for this changeover).
485,Since I primarily access notes offline this is a huge step-down for me since I can't yet see that Evernote is worth the extra expense and NONE of the other premium features are needed by me.
486,As it continued to update it became less and less useful to me as it became less and less simple to use.
487,"With some of the apps, it really would be nice if you could choose to go back to, or not use an upgraded version if it works for you as is."
488,"Bug report on checkboxes Very useful and helpful app, HOWEVER!"
489,Bad UI layout Don't upgrade: the new version uses too much screen space!
490,I use this for regular work and other projects.
491,"Recent update auto assigns a category, making it roughly a 3 step process to change each time something falls in a different category."
492,"I am a paying user for the image search capabilities, but may discontinue that now that this is so hard to use."
493,"Mainly this is due to crazy formatting when clipping a webpage from chrome (menu -> share -> add to Evernote), or even just copy and paste, as 'paste plain text' pastes with exactly the same formatting as the standard paste option."
494,But since the last update the format bar didn't work 😞 and I need it to make notes more dinamic.
495,"The bar appear in the screen but the functions (bold, highlight, list...) didn't work."
496,"Because that I'm looking for new apps, with different formats and options to organize the info."
497,I loved the app until now...with this new update someone messed up on the scan a new document settings.
498,"Seems like someone has it saving each image as a .png in the file name when the actual document is .jpg,.jpeg so it corrupts the file making it not shareable."
499,"Searching has too many problems: locations don't return results, and switching between map/list view makes some entries disappear."
500,UPDATE: I worked with support for 3 separate bugs.
501,Come to find out that it didn't save my work even though I synced multiple times.
502,I'm sure it has something to do  with them wanting me to pay for a premium version but if I cannot get more  than a half a page of notes before I start having problems then I am not  going to consider a subscription.
503,"If I'm gonna live inside a notebook app, it needs to work like I do."
504,"The ""Send Logs"" option under settings opens up an email with logs but there is no recipient."
505,It's extremely unreliable when trying to use it to get work done.
506,Editor is missing not even half the functionality as the one in the web browser.
507,"The only good thing about this is being able to manage posts, pages and comments (move or remove them)."
508,"If you want to edit posts or page on your phone or tablet, you're better to do it another one and copy + paste it in using the web browser admin panel."
509,I was trying to ride through the problems as most of them were small as I loved the search functionality for going through tons of academic notes.
510,"The problems are mostly small but constant, like how evernote will randomly remove some spaces when I try to edit the note in android."
511,"I can access my admin version of the site and start publishing or scheduling, or even adding a draft to set up with getting back with my computer."
512,What I don't like is the bugs and errors when I want to edit something.
513,"I used LG QuickMemo previously, but then I changed devices and after a painful (had to be pdf images->txt via OCR) but eventually successful migration of notes to new phone I decided to use a more renowned app for notes, figured it will work for the future when I change phones again.. import was successful, but I am disappointed with the search function - it seems it didn't index the old notes correctly, especially when there is no internet connection the search just doesn't work!"
514,"I don't need to ""sync my notes across all my devices"" nor to back them up, an Evernote account should be OPTIONNAL, thanks."
515,Limited without annotation options on images Doesn't appear to be any way to add markups or annotations on images that are captured.
516,It's search feature could use a lot of improvement.
517,"But the problem is  , "" I can't upload any posts to my wordpress site with this app "" .... Gosh !!!!"
518,"When I try to post something it shows ""Uploading "" for around 50 seconds and after that it always shows. """
519,"post upload failed : An error occured while uploading the post ""  Even if the post contain just a heading and 3 lines of content ( no media files ) the result is same."
520,"Great potential but needs bug fixes Of course, I like the idea of having an off-line map."
521,"Now it keeps freezing on me if I touch any of the controls Search, Download Maps (I can download only by using the map itself), Settings at the bottom of the screen."
522,But you really do need to work on technical assistance and helping customers that run into problems.
523,Update - Now I keep getting update email notifications - WHY???
524,"Last version is very laggy, may freeze on premium quadcore (mi5s+) for ten seconds with ease."
525,Latest update data hog Latest software update used my network data to automatically download updated maps.
526,Can't find an option to only update maps via wifi.
527,Default should always be to update via wifi with option to use network data.
528,Less and less impressed I am less and less impressed the more I use evernote.
529,I tried using this app on my Infinity Android Tablet PC in place of OneNote during a meeting at work.
530,"Gets worse with every update On launching Evernote, I have to dismiss a full-screen plug for a feature I don't care about."
531,"On my desktop, using the Chrome add on,  the web clipper works well, discards useless page parts and saves the article in readable form."
532,"So when I am at work, I what to be able to look at my To Do list that is only relevant to when I am at work."
533,The other significant SpringPad feature that I would like you to consider is to be able to filter out completed tasks.
534,There are a lot of management features in the PC/web version that I consider very basic.
535,Loading is slow and with the last update you cannot view individual posts.
536,"New Wordpress post editor in a browser lacks a lot options, in app even more: options missing concerning pictures, buttons for formatting hidden... 500 limit"
537,"It's impossible to join a party without having to be sent some scan thing, I'm unable to go on quests, there's no explanation about the weapons you equip (does adding 3 points to my intelligence even do anything since there's no skills?)"
538,"I still haven't figured out what silver does or what benefit you get from marking a task as ""trivial,"" AND I'm unable to see how long it's been since I last checked off a task, so I might end up accidentally marking it twice."
539,"UPDATE - A new error: ""The text of this note is too long for editing."
540,"This was a loss of data, lock and crash event: why wouldn't the company have some way to submit an error report?"
541,"If I create a note using the website, and then continue to edit it on my android, the formatting of the new text changes (size is smaller etc) so I have to go back on the website (using my laptop) to fix it."
542,"I just updated it & can't find the TEXT FORMATTING BAR which contained BOLD FONT, UNDERLINE, HIGHLIGHT, BULLETS, SUBSCRIPT, SUPERSCRIPT."
543,"I have been using this app for several years in classes, starting on the first generation Asus Transformer, and there really hasn't been any changes or updates made since then."
544,"It's overbloated with useless features (chat, connect to FB, Twitter...) but it is missing important features - export to PDF and share (in normal way like every other app do)..."
545,"I wish that the location tagging of notes allow you to specify a location using its name, instead of just a pin on a map, for example being able to tag a location as my works name and make that metadata searchable."
546,"While the program correctly identified my being at my home, and while it correctly identified the name of the street I was on, when I tried to search for my full address, including the house number, it could not find the address and suggested similarly named streets in other towns."
547,"Decent but Android is lagging I use evernote all the time on many devices (OSX, iphone, ipad, Note 10.1) and it's a great service but their Android implementation definitely feels like it lags behind the other platforms."
548,"It's largely in the interaction details, things like notes auto-exiting ""edit"" mode while I'm in the middle of meetings and the lack of formatting feature parity (can't select multiple lines of ""bullet"" items, can't indent checkboxes)."
549,They took away a lot of features they now make you pay for like multiple devices.
550,Its auto save feature is immaculate.
551,"App used to be a solid 5/5, but they pushed out an update that removed functionality that I relied on heavily (widgets daily)."
552,"I have a subscription so I wasn't caught off by the mobile access counting as one device (on the 2 device access limit), but the new update increased loading times as well on Android."
553,The more functions get added the less I like using the app.
554,"Now it's an extra click to the check boxes, while extra screen space is taken up with unnecessary options for formatting and auto indentations etc are making editing my notes messy."
555,"The app does not allow to do basic things like deleting folders, bulk action on notes, it syncs slowly, the basic function of tap-to-edit so common in ALL the other note taking apps is missing."
556,"Storage use on my tablet was 1gb plus and crashing my tablet with no easy way to either 1) unsync folders en masse, or 2) move database to sd card."
557,"Only real option was to uninstall, which worked."
558,Trying now to reinstall and sync no notebooks...  control of storage space and networ usage should be basic features.
559,The update buried the feature I use most in the app This app was great until the last update.
560,I use the app for when I don't want or have time to sit down at my pc to do updates.
561,The app allowed me to be able to easily cycle through all my sites quickly to see if they needed plugin or WP updates.
562,"After selecting the admin option, I could click each site and within minutes have all the sites updated, significantly quicker than using a pc to do it."
563,"With the latest update to the app, the developers buried the admin page access 3 clicks deep, so what would take me 1 click + a click per site to check update status, now requires me to click into the settings, then 2 clicks per site to check for update status."
564,I use a lot of bullet points and I always have a problem when I want to copy all text under bullet points.
565,notebooks need to be paid for so that when you sync you won't need to open notes one by one for offline viewing.
566,Updates have ruined this app The sharing option has been turned into a mess.
567,"When in area without Internet access & spotty cell phone coverage and you try edit or update a Note, it will ""Lock"" the note!"
568,"In addition, I've found out that trying to privately inform Evernote of a bug that is causing me to stop using their product is a paid feature."
569,"Also when using shared notes, if you are revoked access or the shared note is deleted, it still shows up with no way to delete or remove from view (can't do it on web either)."
570,"It is very complicated to create a note from an image one shares from a web browser, because it keeps creating a note with the image's url, instead of attaching the actual image."
571,"This means one needs to save the image in the web browser, and the manually attach the saved image."
572,"I save a note and come back to see that the numbering is off: every line has the same number, or the numbering starts over halfway through the list, or that one line has two numbers and you can't fix it without completely deleting the numbering."
573,"Lastly, notes don't update immediately from one device to another."
574,Updates are a fail Recent updates to Evernote (within the last 2 weeks) have made it impossible to edit existing notes from my android device.
575,"And while I like to be encouraged to switch to a subscription by extra features, but forcing your customers to pay up by removing the core functionality of the app (ability to synchronize across more than 2 devices) is a very ugly business practice."
576,"I'd prefer if free synchronization were back, possibly at the cost of functionality I'm not using - text& image sync on all devices is all I need."
577,Other formatting options are hard to use and different between web and mobile.
578,Some functions simply do not work.
579,There is a progress bar when the image is being uploaded and no matter how many times I try or how long I wait...the image doesn't get uploaded and there is always an error.
580,"It added formatting to a post I had started on my computer, which is funny because in the preview all the formatting is stripped."
581,if i retry maps.me I'll post an update.
582,"Beautiful maps, but lots of problems and missing critical functionality."
583,"5) Since routing time is so inaccurate and lack of alternative routes, no clue whether the actual route it picks is anywhere near reasonable."
584,"If I buy premium account it would represent the MOST expensive piece of software (if U buy win every 5 years and use mostly opensource, Evernote is twice as much = cca 300$) When you read reviews on net - be adviced: they are mostly written by premium account users or by users with almost all time internet conection."
585,Since the new update I can no longer read my notes if I'm offline.
586,creating notes using firefox on galaxy S4: can't select article OR image OR even the most basic function: copy/save whole page!
587,(5 stars w/ disabled spellcheck) Galaxy S9 (used this app on S6 and LG G4 and loved it) overall excellent app i have used for some years now over multiple devices.
588,my problem is that evernote overrides/bugs out the native spell checker which results in the autoreplace preventing me from typing because EVERY SINGLE KEYSTROKE results in a word injection.
589,Saved searches do not work correctly at all.
590,"My saved searches work fine on desktop, but not here."
591,I get a new phone & now I cannot access it unless I upgrade to use on all devices!!
592,"I dont know whats up with this new update, but it was definitely a miss guys."
593,"Frustrated with the latest update to the business card scanning function.The label (phone number, fax, email, etc) only shows when the box is empty."
594,"Has become useless after Dec 17 update Puts up message about needing card space, which takes for ages, which never happened before."
595,"STOP USING YOUR END USERS AS ALPHA TESTERS, DO YOUR HOMEWORK BEFORE LAUNCHING AN ""UPDATE"" YOU CLOWNS!"
596,Half the options for adding a note are at ant given time not even an option.
597,"It's fine to limit the quick select menu to only 6 items, but somewhere on the page you HAVE to give a ""more options"" button to click on to select from all the other options, so as to make them still an option."
598,"HOWEVER, despite all the effort I have put into the  app with adding new places, it never seems to be able to back up my saved  pins for places I like."
599,"When I try logging  into OpenStreetMap on the app, there always says there is an error with log  in."
600,"When you take notes at work or school, do you just throw them all into one folder called ""notes?"""
601,"Some current bugs: 1: If you have more than 5 notes and use it on Yosemite retina forget about using Evernote, takes over 5 seconds to even copy and paste something in."
602,"👍 Sometimes i wanna put my hand-written note on the screen as a widget showing all its details i.e as if its a paper or a sticky note on the home page (bc i need it as reminder but not for a specific time, its mostly stuff i wanna get done with through out a day; like  ""remember to get a gift for your friend"" , i will do it any day during the week when i find a chance, However sometime its more than a note for one subject, so the title only won't be enough) ...2nd: Well, I need this one from time to time: an option to copy/paste from one notebook to another."
