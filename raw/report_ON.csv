1,"Excellent idea but poor execution. There really isn't much to do game wise  especially since the majority of the content is locked behind a paywall. I  understand that they have to monetize it but at 1 million users, ad  impressions may have been a better route instead of a subscription service  that locks out the majority of your player base from the start. There's  also no way to earn crystals other than paying. With so little to do and so  much unavailable unless you pay (with no options to try before you buy)  gives me little motivation to come back. Some advice: ●Make the quests you  can buy with gold cheaper. 200 coins takes forever to grind and there's not  much to do otherwise. �?Have a way for f2p players to earn crystals (maybe  through daily login bonuses, level up bonuses or grind and buy them with  gold). ●Offline capabilities especially for checklists and tasks. I  shouldn't need the internet to check off my to do list. ●Have the ability  to choose your class at the start and allow players to change class  whenever they'd like. Having to wait until you're level 10 is too much of a  grind. ●Have a little more customization available from the start (maybe a  freeby starter egg or a background or outfit). Literally everything is  locked behind crystal pay walls...even the character backgrounds are a  whopping 15 crystals . That just screams greedy.",,,,
2,"Good idea in theory but the interface is way too ham-handed. If I try to set multiple reminders for a task, it seems like it would allow it, but then it discards the second reminder time and only saves the first one. Moving tasks up and down the list doesn't work properly (lags and jitters). Tapping refresh puts them back in their original order making re-sequencing them pointless. Which brings me to another point: refresh has to be tapped constantly to see changes that you make. I created a habit and it seemingly disappeared right after hitting save and wouldn't appear until I refreshed. Also, how do I hear the theme song? I can change it in the settings but tapping each option simply changes which one is active. How am I supposed to know which theme I want if I can't preview it? Another problem is the tutorial: tapping the menu items at the bottom didn't always activate each sections tutorial. For example, I tapped on To-do and created some items, then went to Rewards, saw that tutorial, went back to To-do, and then the app decided to display the tutorial for To-do. Making tasks, habits and goals like an RPG is a great idea. But honestly, I think most people would get frustrated at this clunky interface and just give up after 5 or 10 minutes like I did.",,,,
3,"Idea is great and I love using this app, but parts need refining. Sorting items (ToDos, Dailies, etc) from the app doesn't persist, but doing so from the website does. There is a widget for Habits and Dailies, but not for ToDos, and I this ToDos is the list people would best like to see made into a widget. There is no clean way to take back a button press (If you accidentaly pressed on + and didn't mean to your options are leave it as is even though you didn't earn the rewards or edit the task to include a minus option and take the HP hit). Would be nice if you could automatically sort by Due Date ascending. Creating a Daily and setting it to all days, then editing it and removing the current day still leaves the Daily Active (Same with the reverse if it was first created as not enabled for this day of the week, then editing and enabling it, it remains disabled). Etc , My point is the idea is amazing, there is a huge community behind it which is great, and I personally love the app. But it lacks polish around the edges and some bugs could be fixed.",,,,
4,"This app is so bright it hurts. You're trying to read, write and relax, but the blank color scheme reminds me more of the sun hitting my face at 6am than of me relaxing while browsing.  This app doesn't have some sort of front page like imgur has for example, instead all we get is the ""discover"" feature which only promotes bland, vague and uninteresting posts with no personality. Just look at it right now! Where are the people sharing relatable stories, or video game strategies, or book or tv show reviews or something? All the posts featured there are just... unattractive, to say the least. And it's the only source of new content there is, otherwise you have to look it up manually.  There are no set categories or tags, instead you make them up and unless people type them up exactly like you did they won't see your post, which is counterintuitive and discourages finding new posts or bloggers.  People can disapprove or even edit your comments. That is twisted, discourages freedom of speech and opinion sharing and even allows people to literally put words in your mouth by changing your original comment to whatever they want.  You can't dislike posts or comments, so the voting system is pointless. You might think otherwise because Twitter and Vine have no downvotes,  but they promote discovery of new content in various ways, while WordPress does not.  The search bar doesn't work. I've tried finding my own posts with the exact same title they have and they don't appear.  All of these factors make it feel deserted and lacking of a community, and discourage new users of getting into writing or reading on WordPress. Also there used to be a eay to add a black outline to images; a necessity when the background is white.",,,,
5,"Wonderful potential and with excellent content but not very well executed. UI poor & buggy; connectivity & state-saving bugs; unintuitive & hazy. However, still a tremendous tool with (I don't use this term lightly) life-changing potential despite! I feel as though the gamification aspect is tangential but foundational to the system design. If the user relies on the superficial static pixel-art RPG as the primary mechanic incentivizing their real-world habits, tasks & challenges, they'll plateau real fast, as there isn't much substance to the 'game' side. The social/game features (custom avatars &c.) are steeply ramped to try to drive pay-for-play schemes, so the appeal to some of a casual showoff/hangout sort of play are curtailed. Some of the user-contributed content (mostly in Challenges but also in general chatpost/Tavern) is excellent; imagine self-help style microlessons but from evidence-based and therapeutically-sound sources, as well as plenty of great personal strategic content and tips from a range of people suffering from a variety of impediments to routine/studying/self-care/productivity/etc. sharing what's worked for them. Incredible, and there's also arts exposure, bookclubbing, hobbyisting, and more being done through the system as well. Bottom line is same as the top: This has awesome potential to (actually) help people improve their lives but the system isn't designed very well and on top of that the app isn't up to professional standards.  Don't have it? Get it, and start it. Try it for a couple weeks if you can. Keep reading...",,,,

7,"Updated review: I have used this app for half a year, against my better judgement.  I have sent eighteen bug reports to the devs.  Little.  I could easily send another twenty more, but it isn't worth the time.  This is simply the most bugged piece of software I have ever used.  The avatars are hideous.  The only good thing that this app has going for it is the clean user interface, and a clever separation of the to-do list into three sections.  It is missing some pretty basic to-do list functionality.  The game loads slowly, and doesn't work without an internet connection.  Some of the bugs I've experienced: Reminders pop up on random days, no matter how many times I readjust their settings. Constantly having trouble connecting to the servers. Visual bugs: shows one item, but you get some other item.  Newly equipped main weapon won't show on avatar until app restarted. Progress bars for quests spaz out every time you open the page. Keyboards won't go away once they pop up. And the list goes on and on...",,,,
8,"So far I'm finding it very helpful and it's a great idea but the app for ui is hugely unintuitive and chunks of it seem not to work at all.  There are buttons that just look like explanatory text and other things that look like buttons that aren't.  If I hatch a new pet or try to make a new change to my avatar it can sometimes take several minutes for the app to recognize and show the change, meanwhile I'm trying to figure out what I did wrong.  The entire party structure and invitation setup is needlessly complicated and frustrating.  The actual task/to do list setup is great. That section of the app is what we're here for and it's really great. The reward and group mechanics are good motivators. It's just the structure of the game that needs improvement.",,,,
9,"Problems, Problems, Problems! ------------ First when I installed the app & got some maps, they would disappear from the phone after each re-boot. So, I wrote to the developer. No reply after a month, I wrote back. No reply after two weeks. ------------- Next I uninstalled & re-installed the app (for the 12th time trying to fix the vanishing maps problem). Now the place in Settings to tell the app where to store the maps is gone. Gone! (The SD is 32 GB and has 31 GB free) I wrote the developer. After a week- no reply. ---------- Uninstall Warning: Each time I uninstalled the app., a large folder (Over 1 GB on mine) was left behind on the phone. One must use a file manager to delete it. --------- I Give Up (Which is too bad because this app is easy to use.) UPDATE- As shown below, the someone from the developer company posted suggestions. I had already tried (multiple times) what is suggested in the links the person posted. I also had already sent e-mails to the address shown. I will try one more time to contact them (because it looks like a fun & easy app). If no luck, I'll have to conclude that my phone and this app just won't play well together. UPDATE- Developer replied to this review and asked me for the name I used to contact them. I won't post my e-mail here. (That's not a comfortable thing to do.) I sent a new e-maill to them. I will update the review & star rating when (if) they reply & tell me how to make this application work.",,,,
10,"This is my second time returning, and after a 2 year hiatus, I'm pleased to say that everything I hated about this app is still there and nothing new has really changed. It's so buggy and I can't get any help on any of the bugs I experience. Like the fact that I don't do any damage when my cron rolls over. Yea�?I get no response from the developers.  The only reason I use this app is for the sake of quests? Because everything else is so boring. But even the quests are dull. And if you're in a big party, they don't even scale it properly? There's nothing like having a quest start and then having it finish a couple hours later before you even have a chance to do anything. Not to mention it totally lacks the ability remind you of anything. All it does is nag you everyday at a set time. That's all it's capable of. Set a to do with a due date? Great but you won't get a reminder about it. Not to mention the fact that it still doesn't allow any form of offline capabilities. And they just make up excuses for why they can't have it. Which I don't buy because I've used other apps like this where I can go offline and use it. Its slow as hell.  And for forcing me to be connected to the internet it doesn't even notify me of new posts from my guilds and party.",,,,
11,"Habitica was very fun for a time... then I quickly became disengaged. None of my friends play so I was unable to go on quests. Once I had equipment, a pet, and a mount I liked there was very little remaining to keep me engaged. I can't recommend using it single player. I am aware there are guilds to help you meet parties so you can adventure but I am disinclined to meet strangers just to keep my tasks organized. Also I'll note that the penalties for not engaging in dailies are so minimal that I was never worried about skipping anything... and since the benefits are randomized (apparently heavily towards potion and foods, not eggs) I wasn't incentivized to try for any specific type of activity beyond things I just wanted to get done.",,,,
12,"Great app based on features, AWFUL due to bugs! Still using it daily, after restarting it several times, but the bugs are a huge drawback!  Will change the review once I will be able to rearrange the tasks without having them moved back were they  were (or placed somewhere in-between), when it wouldn't crash when I set a notification on a task, when the party tabs don't appear on tasks view, and when the animals appear in the app when they are found, not hours later (refresh + app restart = no use in this case).",,,,
13,"I seriously don't understand. The basic functions of the app are so janky and broken. In the avatar creation, I had to keep pressing the options I wanted over and over for it to actually work, then when I finished the avatar had options I didn't pick. Every habit defaults to being both positive and negative. I know there has to be some default, but it's kind of weird that if I have a positive habit I have to tap the negative button. Adding tags is really clunky because the tags have to be added to the filter, (I guess it works but it's unintuitive to have to add a tag to the filter instead of just tagging the task itself) but when I add them they don't immediately get added. They disappear and then get added a few minutes later. Half the time it won't let me move around the tasks. Sometimes the FAQ text pops up overlaying whatever screen I'm on. Switching between habits, dailies, to-dos, and rewards is finicky. Sometimes swiping doesn't work, sometimes trading the icon doesn't work. I have to tap things in the equipment menu multiple times for them to work. Same for the avatar menu. With patience all this stuff does eventually work, but it's tedious to just use the app. The app would be 10 times better just by fixing the buggy menus",,,,

OSM doesn't really  support proper Address searching so relying solely on this isn't possible.  I have to go back to Google to find actual full addresses. What I would  like to see changed is; - when searching the results show the downloaded  Map Name which can be confusing as it doesn't match the location of the  address. (please remove this) - would be nice to have other map  overlays/textures to choose from.

15,"The only use for this app over google is it shows trails and jungle footpaths. After that its 'EFFING USELESS. The pointer spins constantly so you cant tell which way you're facing. It points 180 degrees out and the blue dotted line follows you, ie it can send you back the way you came and not leave your start point blank....so you still think youre going the right way as youre always attached to the dotted line. It should let the pointer move away from the dotted line, then you can see youre off course. If you brush the screen it opens a new dropped pin which then deletes the path you were following. I cant bookmark anything. Theres paths highlighted in red that i didnt add, it constantly directs you to road routes even tho i only want mountain footpaths and have it set to walking. It does work offline for me which is 1 reason not to boot it just yet but its useless to navigate with, i use it just to look for trails. Thankfully im not getting ads cos thailand auto blocks anything that isnt of profit directly to them.

It's a bit time consuming trying to make your lists when your changes are lost so frequently.",,,,
17,Update UI issues The UI faces some tremendous update glitches when I try to set big Dailies or To-Dos with lots of checklist items and lots of reminders.

Also the reminders feature though nice to have - they need major refinement. Better have a frequency option for reminders as well.,,,,

The challenges are a joke (I saw one where your challenge was to join their group. How do you consider that a challenge?) I still haven't figured out what silver does or what benefit you get from marking a task as ""trivial,"" AND I'm unable to see how long it's been since I last checked off a task, so I might end up accidentally marking it twice.

Once upon a time this app worked beautifully and did what it should... you see... people posting from their phones are ON THE GO! I just want to post quickly with no hassle- the control needed but not clutter. Many times its mobile data, in a remote location. The app used to be lean and mean and do the job perfectly.

What used to take seconds... select some pics on phone ... share to WP app... add text hit upload and DONE... is now futz with this and that ... fight the awful quirks ...hit post and wait wait wait...error. error.

21,"The idea is wonderful. But a lot of tedious mistakes spoil the whole impression. For example, information is slowly updated even within the application, often clicking on a menu item is ignored. If you create a task without a title, but with a list, it will become closed for editing, just delete. Not all things are obvious. I had to read help to solve simple questions. Well, the old-school 8-bit graphics - not everyone likes it.",,,,
22,"I really, really wanted to like this. The concept is genius, but the execution needs a little tweaking. I had a difficult time using the app, because the tutorials were very basic and didn't cover most of what to do. It seemed like if you didn't buy gems, then you couldn't go on quests. I appreciate that the developers need and deserved to be paid for their hard work, but not being able to use most of the rpg elements, negated the motivation to stay productive and use the app. I like the idea of accountability among friends, but the invite system is unusable. It's a QR code and aside from having no idea what to do with it, every time I clicked on it, it downloaded somewhere I couldn't find it on my S8. With a few changes, this could be an amazing app, but it feels like many of the gameplay elements were added as an afterthought to a regular organization app instead of making being productive in real life feel like a game. I love the health system and the seperation of habits and dailies. I also love that you're health decreases when you don't complete a daily task. If the party and questing system were improved, my productivity and appreciation for this app would soar. Please don't stop improving and developing this app. It could be a trendsetter for a whole new genre of games.",,,,
23,"I wanted to like this app. I'm looking for an alternative to google maps. The routing is actually ok, although the estimated timings don't take traffic conditions into account. The offline operation is good, but there isn't really an 'online' mode. If I currently have a good connection I want to be able to search a new area without having to download the section first. But what has killed it for me is that the search is useless. There us no UK postcode search, which is what I primarily use. Searching by street name sometimes works, but often comes up empty. Conversely when there are multiple matches adding extra location details (borough, etc) doesn't narrow the search effectively. As far as i can tell it treats each term entered separately and at some point if you haven't chosen one of the matches for your first term and keep typing it switches to searching on the second term, ignoring the first. I only managed to experience the navigation by finding places on Google maps, and then matching the street pattern and zooming to find them manually in this. I gather it works better in some countries than others, so I'll probably try it again sometime, but for now I'm giving up.",,,,

Where did it go and how do I get it back? If this is not fixed I am uninstalling the app as it is totally useless to me without the full version of the editor.

Woe be unto you if you mak long pots, because after a certain size copy/paste stop working and the editor gets so slow you have to wait for the displayed text to catch up to you. What it does do well is present your stats page, manage the site permissions and let you get a rough draft started.

Habitica's manual frames it as if it's not their, but user's fault.  I have more than a dozen of Habits and about the same amount of Dailies, most of which are themselves checklists. I keep track of multiple habits, therefore I open Habitica and press + and - many times a day, sometimes several times in an hour.

It works best if you find your destination address with a browser, as the names in OSM don't always match. Due to size limits, searching by street numbers is not possible and this severely limits your options. The app goes nuts if your GPS is broken, and you can't just follow the route by moving the map with fingers, as popups keep reappearing.

EDIT: I understand that advertising is a resource that allows for development to continue, but you must understand the current default implementation makes any features very unappealing and the entire experience unenjoyable. I uninstalled imediately after the second push ad. Push ads are unacceptable in any form.  I am aware you can opt out of most advertising by going to settings and switching off ""Show offers"", but there's no garuntee your app will stop giving other unwanted push notifications, such as the one asking if the user is aware of the bookmarking feature. DO NOT engage the user outside of the app unless it is for a currently requested function or feature they are actively using, such as continuing navigation while in the background. There are better ways to let users know of features. For example, highlight the area you want to be noticed and give a brief message when the app is launched. This is more benificial for you as well, because a user is more likely to follow through when they have already chosen to engage with the app, as opposed to you trying to pull them away from whatever else they may be doing.",,,,

Also, no way to enter a street number. Which seems pretty basic and shocking that it doesn't allow user to specify a street number!   Disappointing. I just spent 20 minutes trying to enter in the address of a location.   Suggest you hire some UI designers and product managers to do a better job redesigning this app, to be user friendly and make it easy for users to do simple things, like actually entering in an address!  In response to Developer's ""fixing"" the 2 missing EXAMPLE addresses I listed, that's like a drop  in the ocean. The problem is NOT simply that it couldn't locate the 2 EXAMPLE addresses I listed. The problem is deeper. It was unable to properly locate an arbitrary, VALID, address. This is something Google Maps can do EASILY.   Based on this rather GLARING defect, I think this largely makes this app unusable for general purpose navigation..",,,,
39,"Useful but to be improved. 1) it's missing a search field.  2) no multi select and upload of multiple images from a single folder, it's either messy all together or one by one. 3) I lost the whole text and images of a new post because of an internet connection error, this should not happen no matter how bad the connection is, offline editing is what users expect from an application vs the web-admin! 4) post settings button is hidden when keyboard is open 5) can't edit site url 6) can't batch upload local charges",,,,
40,"Too much for too little. I have several sites that run WordPress and finally getting around to reviewing this WordPress app.   To sum it up, it really isn't all that great. The dashboard within WordPress by default allows galleries and custom posts. All this app does is allows you to write a blog and add a photo or video. There is no setting featured image, adding a gallery and unless you modify the dimensions of the photo you insert, it will maintain the full size. Just log into WordPress via the Web and do your stuff there.",,,,
41,"Routes are unstable. While following proposed route I was requested to turn back and follow a new route.  Missing ""do not download"" option in map diwnload dialog window. Unable to configure localisation of the map directory. Menu bar disappears at random? Navigation proposes routes violating the law and mistakes public roads with field roads.  After update navigation is much worse. No perspective view despite it is enabled in settings. Calculating a route is slow, arrival estimation changed from optimistic (below 4h) to pessimistic (over 8h) for a route Krapkowice-Warszawa (Poland, realistic estimate ca 5h). Rerouting freezes very often.  Figured out how to enable perspective view. I had to disable it, close the app, reopen the app and enable it. I fear of other bugs.",,,,
42,"Expecially after the updates of the last months, the app shows issues that make it not usable:  -it cannot make a path on a map not updated (and if you are abroad without Internet and unlucky enough to miss the update, you cannot use the app, which denies the usefulness of it); -you cannot zoom on the rough map if you do not download the detailed map first, so you cannot get an idea of zones you did not download (not even the zones that are clearly visible on the rough map when not zooming); -full of pop-ups and messages you cannot remove, covering the map and being extremely annoyng; -the ""search"" option is horrible, sometimes cannot find even extremely famous places (try searching ""San Marco"" in Venice...).",,,,
43,"I love it except, and this is a big issue for me, it's totally server based. Want to update anything, but have a bad internet connection? Too bad, it's either going to take forever or fail. I would use and maybe even pay for this app to just have a way to have everything first be saved on my device. So, back to hunting for a to-do app. Edit 3/23: I have to drop my review on this to 1 star. You can manually edit values within the app for stats making any it unreasonable that I need internet.",,,,
44,"Blatant internal storage hog.  Each time the app is updated, it decides to fill up the internal phone storage, rather than the the SD card. And following an app update, you then MUST re-download ALL previously downloaded apps, and again, fill up the phone storage not the SD.  At over half a Gigabyte of app and mapping data, this app is just blatantly greedy, and the developers are either too lazy or too incompetent to design an app appropriately to store directly on exterior SD card storage. ----------- WHY do I have to download maps again following app update?  EDIT: why also the need to automatically start up at boot?  This app is getting very tiresome to use - weekly updates, repeatedly having to download all previous map files after every app update, frequent nag screens.  Just develop a simple app - which works properly, doesn't nag its users, and doesn't gobble up huge amounts of data!",,,,
45,"I almost rated this for stars. It's a nice, useful app with some gaps--I really like the basic idea and the maps themselves are accurate and occasionally have nice details (for example, airport gate numbers).  There are some major gaps in searching for foods, shopping, etc., though. Primarily this is just in not having locations. For example, in one city in Japan I did a search for food and it came up with maybe 3 or 4 places when I was aware of dozens close by.  Since it pretty quickly looks for options further away, I was getting results up to fifty miles away (in Japan, traveling fifty miles can take several hours).  It also missed the biggest shopping center in the area.  Still, it's handy for knowing where you are and had the ability to download sections of the world's you're interested in.the interface is also easy to navigate and it came up with Japanese city names easily even though I was using English letters.  Train stations are well-marked and it's pretty easy to follow along with your reason trip to know how much further you need to go and where to get off (note that the routing itself i s by driving rather than public transport, which would have been a nice feature, but that you can simply see where the tracks are).",,,,
46,"Doesn't post a new blog if I clear the 'uploading...' notification The new blog posting process is somehow interrupted and doesn't finish completely if I clear the 'uploading...' notification.  As a user I would assume that such a process should continue in the background.  Next, if I open the app again, it doesn't show any indication of the ongoing process which doesn't give me any kind of update (of whether the new blog got completely/half way uploaded/or cancelled).  To check this, if I manually click the 'refresh' icon on top-right corner, it gives a warning message which is really doesn't help the user what his/her action should be.",,,,
47,"It's worse sorry Since the last update I can't use my regular photo viewer to choose pictures from my post. I now have a list of images that seem to come from my tablet but not it's sd card; where all my images are. I have around 30,000 images in various picture folders (I am travelling and have a 128GB sd card in my tablet where my images are stored)  and this update to 3.9 has made choosing images impossible.  I have two possible workarounds. Either I upload the images to google or similar and put a link in the post to them. Or my second option is to upload the images in the WordPress app through the media menu item and then choose these images I want in the post using your new chooser interface.  Honestly I see what you are trying to do with the new interface but it does limit the user as to how they choose their images. Handing this task over to the operating system, as it was before, makes more sense and makes your app lighter.  Please switch back to the normal way of adding images. Updating posts on tablets and phones has been great with the WordPress app and I feel it's just been made more difficult with this update.",,,,
48,"This app used to be perfect and previously helped me navigate around the world, but after updates these last few months, the app will no longer work offline. Unless I am connected to wifi, the app hangs on the preloading screen logo. Consequently, the app is now useless to me.

When I go to click on the task, it has changed 3-5 of the other tasks to one of the other task names ie) ""blue shirt/red pants/headphones/eno"" then if I change the order of a task, then it might look like this next time, deleting some tasks: ""blue shirt/blue shirt/blue shirt"" It's pretty frustrating because I want to like the app but can't trust it seriously to store important tasks in my life. The reliability is poor.",,,,
50,"I really really want to like this app.  I can get as far as setting up and tracking tasks, which is awesome. But as soon as I try to form a party and battle monsters, it runs up against some issue with Google authentication (I think) and I can't go any farther. I even tried to delete my account and start over, but when you get to the step were it says ""type delete in all caps""... there is no keyboard or place to type.

52,"This app has gone downhill. Now that Google maps supports offline maps there is absolutely no reason to use this app. It still causes my device to restart. No other app makes my phone restart, only this one. It uses a dodgy background process that makes my phone restart even after I finish using app. They need to add a ""exit"" button to properly close the app. It keeps running services in background even when I force quit the app via task manager. It crams a lot of junk and annoyances in the app. I don't want business names or the ability to rate or share or whatever other junk they force in there. Let me turn all the junk off so I can use the map like a map. Stop asking me to turn on location settings. I use offline maps and not interested in going online and ""writing a review"" of map locations.",,,,

And the browser version has some bugs too, sometimes logging in it will display in Pt DESPITE being set to English (I assume it's my browser's settings, but the page's options SHOULD prevail over), and synching will sometimes take gold, health or mana away randomly.

Just to add that I have used maps from my sdcard correctly for a few years now!  This rating only applies to the latest version which screwed up my configuration.

After a few days and several rookie mistakes that aren't explained well in the tutorial, I realized this app is way too heavy on the game mechanics for my use. I want to have a list of dailies to partially complete everyday, to encourage reading and writing every now and then, not everyday. This app punishes you for not checking these things off everyday. I totally didn't realize my character was losing tons of health until it hit the red zone. I then started reading up on the death mechanic and am very turned off. I can understand wanting to give the players consequences for missing a task, but it shouldn't be health loss and it should account for how the player uses the dailies (must complete everyday or bonus if completed). They also do not make it easy to provide feedback. All the discussion links either required creating a separate account (different from the habatica account) or were closed threads. This app could be so fun but I feel it loses sight of promoting good habits/organization. I love gaming, but this is super heavy handed mechanics to me. Would keep using this app if I could keep the lists alone.",,,,

People follow my blog or like a specific post but somehow there are no views that day. The notifications are useful but sometimes seem inaccurate.,,,,

Also no option for using motorway if available. Not good. Also it would be useful to be able to have waypoints and preferred routes and types of roads to avoid. Updated version now doesn't bring up saved favourites when planning route when tapping on To button.

67,"It's a good idea. It really is. However, the app for both desktop and mobile is VERY flawed in its execution. The layout is not very well thought out, I personally don't think the sprites are good looking (albeit that is admittedly a deeply subjective opinion which I am not asking be changed), and the mobile app in particular has a lot of trouble syncing your tasks if you add another task on your PC. I added one to-do to the list on pc yesterday, but it has yet to show up in the app, despite numerous refreshes and attempts to sync the two. That, in my opinion, is a big flaw. Perhaps, in time, it could be a good app. For now, it's merely serviceable. Mediocre. It can certainly be used without major issues, but there is plenty room for improvement.",,,,

And when visiting someone's blog, I prefer seeing an outline of their posts, which can help me access ANY post of that person, over an incomplete list of posts sorted chronically which doesn't display all of their posts (some of them are only accessible on the app through browser, so what's the point of using the app over browser?)",,,,

Alright, first use... I search for something like post adjustments (oh, they were in the footer!), and changed the post to local draft. But it NEVER went to draft again in the blog!. Worst than that, I continued editing it, and the next time I accessed it, a message appeared, something like ""the post is not updated, do you want to?"" and I thought of course, upload the changes, but what it did was download the first draft (the published one) overwriting the last one so I completely lost ALL of my work.

It is a very simple thing : the option to save maps to SD CARD.  Sometimes an update would relocate your maps to the phone, sometimes it would delete all maps, sometimes you had to uninstall and reinstall, sometimes ....  This time they have surpassed it : it moved all my SD CARD maps to memory, filling it right up!! And today there is no option to locate maps to SD CARD any more.  2 years and they still can't get this simple but ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL feature to hold.  So, finally, I'm done and, guess what, in doing so, after trying 8 apps I have found an even better one :  HERE MAPS.",,,,

Mind you, i'd never talk to anyone like that in a public group. i don't mind policing the language of users if they are abusive or using foul language like that in public, but to me its a bit much to ban people for a private conversation, where there was no victims, but its not within my power to change the community guidelines. hopefully i'll get unbanned so i can give the app a swing. it does seem great. only 3 stars for being so quick to jump the ban hammer. will definetly change stars for the better, if the community guidelines loosen up in regards to private conversations and partys. maybe add a report button instead?",,,,

The biggest shortcoming for me was that with just about all osm apps, the POI/address search are useless unless those items are entered in the osm database. A suggestion would be to have a online search function (like MapFactor's google search) to be able to find those items and be able to translate the info into an offline nav point. Another suggestion would be to improve the display functions during navigation, ie: speedometer/speeding warnings, lane assist, and fixed speed cameras.

The app also seems to only give you one route  choice, no option to change to quickest or shortest in the settings, or  avoid motorways etc. Can't really comment on much else as I gave up after  learning those things. All in all it's basic, the navigation is competent  but very sensitive to kinks in a road (so be prepared to bear left / right  a lot when you're just following a road).

However the real problem is that I am unable to create anything but short routes due to the limitations in the amount of stops that I can add; given there are tons of forest roads you can never pick the one you like and make something longer than 30km of a route; It also isn't even a paid feature, I'd have paid for such feature in a heartbeat.  Two fixes, having 3 stops is ok if I can chain routes, as in save them and load them quickly; or allowing to add up to 10+ stops, the average that you need on 80+km rides on these forest mazes.  Back to square one having to buy a GPS, and these garmins aren't cheap at all; I am however pleased on how close this was to actually work, that I dared to write this review; hoping they implement it, even if it's paid; maybe they can have competition in something they never expected to.",,,,
149,"The update buried the feature I use most in the app This app was great until the last update. The part of the app that I used the most was the admin page access.

I use the app for when I don't want or have time to sit down at my pc to do updates.      Where I thought the app shined was maintaining my WP sites. The app allowed me to be able to easily cycle through all my sites quickly to see if they needed plugin or WP updates. After selecting the admin option, I could click each site and within minutes have all the sites updated, significantly quicker than using a pc to do it.    With the latest update to the app, the developers buried the admin page access 3 clicks deep, so what would take me 1 click + a click per site to check update status, now requires me to click into the settings, then 2 clicks per site to check for update status.    I considered this app a 5 star app before this bizarre change. I'm hoping it was an oversite or test on the developers part and that they'll fix this in the next update.

155,"I was really excited about this app when I first started planning a road  trip overseas. There are a lot of places I searched for to pin that the app  didn't find. It's search feature could use a lot of improvement. But the  deal breaker for me was found when I tried texting the offline navigation  in my home city the other day. I searched a location on the other side of  the city. The app only offered me one option for a route and, as a local,  it's not one that I would ever take - neither fastest nor shortest  distance. I started out on the route anyway and then purposefully deviated,  waiting to see how it would handle the route change. The answer is not  well. It directed me to turn around for the next several minutes even  though I was headed towards a major freeway, which was closer. If I'm using  this overseas and a road is closed for whatever reason, this app is never  going to help me get around the detour. Im going to have to figure it out  myself. Even after I got on the freeway, navigation continued to try to  route me off at the next several exits, which would have been way out of  the way. I'm super disappointed. Will definitely be trying another app  instead.",,,,

This app isn't good enough if the visitor has to go to my website and using a browser, use the Archive widget on my blog.  If there is a setting that all 3 of us have overlooked, I'd be very glad to know what that is. Otherwise, I'll just recommend the regular Dot Com site using a browser  Update April 18 2018:  The developers got back to me and informed me that the app can only handle the latest 300 posts. So 300 posts and that is it. Since I write over 300 posts a year, well, that won't cut it for my followers.

162,"Great potential but needs bug fixes Of course, I like the idea of having an off-line map. I downloaded a few of them. They seem fairly accurate, easy to read and have a lot of very useful details by default without decreasing the readability. So from that point of view I would give at least 4 stars. Now it keeps freezing on me if I touch any of the controls Search, Download Maps (I can download only by using the map itself), Settings at the bottom of the screen. Also some details (such as shops and bus stops are missing) and at least in one case a bus stop would show only at a specific scale. So I am only giving 3 stars right now but there is a great potential for an excellent app... PS. And I also like the fact they try to answer most of the reviewers when appropriate!",,,,

I was driving and it took me through footpath though on car and I got stuck on the way and had to leave my car and continue on foot since I didn't have any other option...

They take no responsibility for routes not working because they are using some other company's maps. Removed.",,,,
166,"Disappointing The big plus is the offline use of maps and the maps that look good. On the downside: we disagree on the fastest route. On first use it misses a connection to a highway and suggesting a longer route. Then the app even tries to send me back three times unnecessary, making the journey even longer. Vocal directions are ambiguous compared to my regular Garmin nav and compared to Google. Maybe it's just the dutch language. At times the GPS update seems out of sync with the actual location. Good as a backup nav.",,,,
167,"Even though I tried this with different keyboards it's editing capabilies are poor.   They don't come up to any of the external editors that I have on my tablet.   Compared to the pc/web version this is crippled.  One reason I would like an external editor is that I have a lot more formatting capability and the ability to 'snapshot' or, for example, undo deletions.  rather than sweat coding more editor functions, simply flipping into an more capable external editor seems sensible.  There are a lot of management features in the PC/web version that I consider very basic.  being able to edit the raw HTML code to correct errors or carry out formatting that the 'visual' mode doesn't permit is one.   Again, this might be resolved with an external editor: edit in visual/text or in html switch.  Perhaps the simplest demonstration of what's lacking is to run the tablet and the PC/web version side by side.  I realize there is a screen real estate issue, especially when trying to run this on a 4.5 inch phone, but perhaps that's a case of ""you shouldn't be doing that"".  However other applications I use do have panels that pull down or pull in from the side.    ... out of space ...",,,,
168,"Address search I had no trouble  understanding the instructions for entering an address search. Because I never found any such instructions. The developer's quick reply to those 2 sentences was simple but ineffective. ""Enter the country name"" etc etc?  Ah, they redefined the problem! Enter the info where? The search icon opens a drop down list, but does not appear to open a blank to enter anything. Wait! Wait! One can click on what looks like the list's title bar and type in an address? Why not say that in the first place? OK now we're getting some place.",,,,
169,"Nice map interface! Works fine, but cumbersome to use, almost impossible to locate addresses and limited capabilities! eg. the search results did not reflect the known address or city typed in; two US States were downloaded and every address search for the secondary State only gave results in the primary (home) state; responded slowly to Rerouting, resulting to missing a critical turn; a favorite place was identified and stored, but seemed locked and wouldn't open, when selected.....",,,,
170,"severely flawed app I was favorably impressed with the quality of the maps that came with Maps with Me Light; so, I ordered the full version.  However, I found that full version severely flawed. While the program correctly identified my being at my home, and while it correctly identified the name of the street I was on, when I tried to search for my full address, including the house number, it could not find the address and suggested similarly named streets in other towns. When I asked for the Walgreen pharmacy, it identified such pharmacies in distances of over 4 miles, but failed to identify the pharmacy that is less than half a mile from where I was. When I asked for restaurants, it failed to identify the 99 Restaurant two blocks away from my home, while identifying another restaurants offer the same chain, several miles away.  In my opinion, the application completely failed the test. If I were in an unfamiliar city, (which is the point of a mapping application), I need to find the nearest gas station, ATM, pharmacy, or a specific address. If I cannot rely on Maps with Me to do that, I have no use for it. I have requested cancellation of my purchase.",,,,

They'll reappear eventually, but again if I then have more than 2-3 things... poof.  To do checklists are also buggy. I just added four new items to a list, and after saving it shows only two of them, and those two each show up three times.

This makes my decade old tomtom seem speedy. 3) Route time is WILDLY inaccurate. Over 7 hrs to drive 200 miles by highway? YGBSM 4) No apparent way to get an alternate route. I couldn't even find any way to force it to go through a waypoint. (Another deal breaker for me.) 5) Since routing time is so inaccurate and lack of alternative routes, no clue whether the actual route it picks is anywhere near reasonable.

The best I've seen. 2) Useful info on POIs including hours, phone, website, etc. is great. 3) Can use national level overview maps with cities and interstates without any download.

There is a very unstable behavior you need to solve. When walking along a planned path, even a very straight one, the view keep rotating clockwise and back. This is annoying behavior. 4. When walking along a plan path, the software does not take care to move the visible map window, therefore I have to take care of this. 5. It should be possible to decide which data layer is drawn.

The main one for me was the fact that, once you pick a subject for your journey you can never go back and change that. I mean, there are multiple journey subjects to choose from and maybe I want to focus on one aspect of my life at a time. The app treats life like a game, after all and most games allow you to start over with different settings. Starting over in THIS game requires you to uninstall the app, reinstall the app and then create a brand new account. Kind of silly and frustrating to boot. Check out the Level Life Up app instead. It has a much better platform.",,,,

I tried uploading a picture on my provider network and over WiFi, neither worked. The other issue I'm having is that I can't seem to check categories for my post. I have to log in through my browser to do that. It may be user error but I couldn't find that option. All in all, it works for generic text posts - at least for me. I'll take that over NOTHING!",,,,
214,"Does not work with several popular comment subscription plugins. If a blog has comment moderation enabled, and then an administrator replies to  (and thereby approves) a comment which is ""pending moderation"" from within this app, the comment author will never get the reply notification email.   This is because this app appears to somehow bypass the `wp_set_comment_status` hook when administrators reply to a ""pending moderation"" comment within the app. The `wp_set_comment_status` hook is what fires the reply notification emails for many comment subscription plugins.  There is a clue that the developers know of this bug (I do see it as a bug) because, in this app, an administrator can ""Reply"" to comment that is pending moderation, but in the regular WP Admin interface, the button is labeled ""Approve and Reply"" not just ""Reply.""  I hope this gets fixed as it would be great to use this app to approve and reply to comments, and fire the `wp_set_comment_status` hook so that comment authors can receive email notification of the replies.",,,,

Update: I found the problem - it started to download ""Quebec city"" and I stopped it, because Sherbrooke is in Quebec province and the two are not the same. There are other errors, like Montreal city-Quebek, where k should be a c. Good thing this app lets you contribute to open street maps, but all those mistakes I mentioned are not OSM errors.

For articles with paragraphs embedded in tables you have to scroll left and right for every line of text just to read it (a great example of this is any list of episodes article for a TV show).

You have to select a road outside the landmark, what?? Secondly when doing search for somewhere like Xi'an China if you forget the apostrophe Xian City  itself does not appear, just 300 hotels etc in Xian that spell it without the apostrophe.

It feels like something you would have on your phone back when touchscreens were a new thing. The most annoying bugs are: party screen not updating after you accept a quest invitation so you're not sure if you accepted it, spamming buffs sometimes reduces your mana without actually applying the buff and party chat not updating (have to restart the app to see new messages)",,,,
272,"""Best App of 2014""? I'd sure hate to see the worst! I'm guessing the reviewers who rated it #1 tested it exclusively in one state because this GPS app can't even cross map boundaries. If you want to go from Burbank to Las Vegas, you'll have to set up the California portion, then a separate Nevada portion. Unbelievable. Selecting a destination is an awkward process that involves manipulating the map. Sheesh! The best Android GPS I've found so far is ""MapFactor GPS Navigation"", which provides a variety of ways (such as Google Search) to quickly select any number of waypoints and destinations, plus traveling between states is not a problem.",,,,
273,The ads have become very intrusive. An important part of the screen has the ad and it is difficult to select a map function without hitting the ad. It isn't worth it anymore.  Trip planning is an exercise in patience.It is repeatedly suggested that I download my current location not the country map I am trying to work with for a vacation.  Everything is a charge! The UI is not very intuitive and trying to select a route between 2 bookmarked locations - well - I still haven't figured that out!  Really - Google Editor Choice? Methinks not!,,,,
274,"The reminder system is not very robust, and that should be one of the most important things. I would like more than one daily reminder for everything. I will do tasks at different times of the day, thus I need reminders that are task specific. It also requires a connection in order for you to set tasks, and if you have no signal you are out of luck. I do love the idea, fix these two things and I'll reinstall.",,,,
275,"Seems really cool but every time I try to add/edit/delete something, I get a ""connection error"" pop-up. Says to try again later due to a problem with the server and doesn't follow through with the action I was performing. Would definitely continue using this app if it would let me but it's pointless with this bug",,,,
276,Edit: Reverted to old version or something and issues are back :( Edit: Issue fixed and new update is great! Seems like you actually passed the issue along instead of making complaining subscriber have to repeat the complaint in email... Huge fan of Habitica. Used it for years. It was called HabitRPG when I started. Only to-do list app I have stuck to. Encourages you to build good habits in a fun way. Community-built. No ads...worth subscribing to support the app.,,,,
277,"I AM SO SORRY I EVER INSTALLED IT. This app is malfunctioning in several ways, relating to strange displays of blog text. Once OVERLAPPING so the post displayed UNDER or OVER the photo of prior post. The next time, yesterday, so the text displayed WAY OUT TO THE RIGHT. Reader has to swipe far, far to the keft to view it. What a disaster for a writer trying to create a following of readers.",,,,

279,"Overall usefull for navigating, especially metros. The search function is pretty weak, it does not pull up places even though they are listed on the map. I will keep using the app, but something I hope they fix is the map recentering on the last geo location in offline mode/no signal. Its pretty annoying if everytime you open the app you lose sight of your location because your last phone detected location is in a different town or even country.",,,,
280,"1) Does not store its data in the proper path (Storage/data/Android/com...), but unnecessarily clutters the top-level storage (which also causes its data to be missed by backup software). I reported this over 6 months ago, but the issue remains. 2) Navigation stops working if you turn off the screen. Leaving the screen on continuously burns through way too much battery to make this feasible during travel...despite this being a travel-oriented app. 3) As soon as you start navigating, the compass stops working (arrow no longer shows your orientation). They claim this is ""by design,"" but it is unlike all other map/navigation apps, cannot by disabled via options, & makes it impossible to know which way you're facing without stopping & restarting navigation",,,,
281,"Very slow internet and while everything else works fine this app constantly reports that I'm not connected and my changes and updates are unpredictable. I.e. habit will have old name but the description did successfully update... Very frustrating as this is the only app that I've had any connection issues with, others work and communicate just fine.",,,,
282,"It used to be good and still is for basics but: 1) offline navigation instruction completely wrong. The voice says to go straight but instead you need to exit the motorway on the right. 2) rerouting takes too long time most of the times. The navigator keeps on following the route it expected despite the road I took is wrong (for the above mentioned reason). 3) expected time of arrival... the calculator is really negative at the beginning but optimistic after a few km... if I plan a 200km road, the first time indication is about 4hrs (or anyway higher than any reasonably possible time). After 100 or 120km, despite I'm still missing 80km road, the expected time of arrival drops to 1 minute.  Driving with your app has become hard!",,,,
283,"Meh... I ended up using Google Map for the whole trip Search results are terrible. I keep getting many churches for POI or street names instead of the actual places. It couldn't find state parks or national parks visitor centers.  Can't see all the search results on the map. Can't input address. And there's no direction to the place, which makes the app even more useless.",,,,

Arrgh! ) so now my workflow on mobile is to use this pile of steaming ... to upload images in the broken beta editor... RANDOM resize the images close enough, publish the post but delete it, then log into the browser editor and resize the images correctly in the library then insert into a new post. Broken but at least (FOR NOW UNTIL ITS WRECKED AGAIN) I have a work around.",,,,
287,"Good for reading, a pain for editing. It's a great app for reading and browsing the encyclopedia. The main problem I have with it on that front is that the way it displays lead images in article headers often cuts off important parts of the image; see for example Hammerton Killick- it cuts off his head!   Editing is more problematic - talk pages are impossible to get to, as is article history. Talk and history can be beneficial for readers as well as they give valuable info about reliability and sources of content.",,,,
288,For the most part I love this app but lately it has started moving items around on my daily list when I check them done it's mostly when an item has a checklist of things to be done on them and it's really annoying to have to constantly reorder my list back in the order that I had it in. I would definitely change my rating if this bug got fixed.,,,,
289,"The app gets worse and worse with each release. It used to be much better in terms of responsiveness and usability.  Probably the worst part is how slow search functionality has become. Even simple search takes like half a minute (iOS version suffers from the same problem). Even worse: after these incredible delay, it is not even guarantied that found POI are sorted properly: in many cases it wouldn't find closest one, for example.  Of course there are great stuff too, like ability to download regions separately, but search functionality is something you deal with daily, and recently it is very-very lame.",,,,
290,"Not bad - needs a minor tweak Good for offine use. Google maps is hopeless even if you have saved an area for offline use. Room for improvement: change the colour scheme of the search input box - cannot see gray text on greenish background, which makes it hard to know what I have typed in! Sometimes it goes white, but most of the time it is gray. Other than that, the app actually tells me where I am!",,,,
291,"My maps are stored on the sd card but updates always change it to the phone which isn't large enough. Now I have to download a world map before I can change back the storage location in the settings and is unuseable if no wifi. ""Here we go"" maps doesn't give me this hassle.",,,,

295,"Numerous Issues App lacks a lot of basics when trying to write a post (font alignment options and such) which is annoying. Push notifications have stopped working, even though I have them enabled in the settings. The app does not sync with anything done on another device (whether a pc or another mobile device) so I can't draft a post on my phone then do final editing and uploading on the computer or vice versea etc. So many little issues add up to an app that is a hassle to use rather than the convenience it should be.",,,,
296,Was brilliant now a bit crap.... I have 2 self-hosted sites.... I can add both to the app and make posts however the main use I have for the app is stats which I can see one sites stats but not the other and I end up in an endless loop of logging in to my wordpress account to connect to jetpack....

297,"This app screews up everything you already have made. If you have used/or are using the web part of wordpress and combines it with this app...it screews up everything.

If you have set FULL SIZE on images in the web edit and the uses this app, it resizes ALL images to very small when you open/edit only one of the posts...it has made my page horrible and made a LOT of extra work afterwords",,,,

One more thing, why have the option to login if you can't have access to your saved pages and history across all your devices? Why reinstalling the app should leave you with an empty bucket?

Then, when I delete a post, it only deletes on the site itself, on the app, it will keep showing. It's tiring really. Then again, the app starts hanging when I am creating a post.",,,,
302,Uploading media does not work properly. Some files do not upload and the app does not resume automatically which is annoying. But even worse: Some files are uploaded several times if you try to re-upload and then you end up with duplicates. Also if the app closes in the background it starts uploading all media of a post again. There is also no source editing. Recently it just started crashing in the media library. In summary the media upload is useless.,,,,
303,"I really want to use this app, but on my Galaxy S10, the first 2 of the 3 slides in the introduction before logging in, are blank. The character visuals on the character customization are invisible, and on the settings menu, I scroll down and the options start to overlap each other (hard to describe). I will consider reinstalling after the graphical issues are fixed because it seems like a great app, but currently it's unusable for me.",,,,
304,"It's okay. I'm not a big fan of this app overall. The layout on my tablet leaves a lot of negative unused space, if you put the options icons on the left and had a view of your feed/blog on the right it would greatly improve upon that. I do not like how you can not preview or view any blog, I think its a bit absurd that I have to use my browser to actually see my blogs. I also noticed you can not add/create a new blog on the app, I would have to do this in the browser as well and reload my account into this app for the new blog to appear in the drop down. Over all the app is visually appealing, quick and operates effeciently on my tablet, but the missing features completely deture me from keeping this app when I can probably find a compatible blogging app that suits my needs more. Or just use my browser. I'll check back later and redownload if improvements are made, I am a fan of wordpress but this app is nearly useless as is.",,,,
305,"Useless search and routing function When I enter an address that I know is valid, app keeps giving a search error and tells me to change the search criteria...to what I have no idea. I read the help and entered the address according to the example, but no bueno. Google Maps has no problem with giving me routing intructions to that same address, but unfortunately, won't allow saving for offline use.",,,,
306,"The app regularly crashes as I type. It freezes and grinds to a crawl just as often. The app fails to recognize letters as I type them and it deletes spaces after words. A solution is to work in html mode. It appears that these bugs are only an issue when you have images display while editing a post. The more images, the worse the problem. It seems unbelievable that WordPress, with its QA resources, can't fix these issues.",,,,
307,"It's been a very handy and useful app, and from the functional point of view continues to be. But I'm VERY disappointed with the latest update which started to show me ads in the Bookmark's pane. It is really annoying (especially animated ads) and eats valuable space. I would rather buy a paid version of the app, instead of being forced to see ads in the app I use a lot. Please consider removing ads or introducing a paid version of the app without any ads, instead of turning into yet another ad",,,,
308,"It's ok. It can be frustrating to use. The directional arrow sometimes keeps turning round and round and then points to the wrong direction. Nov. 2019: I just did the maps.me update--the search function doesn't work the same way it used to before the update. I used to be able to put the number of the house or building, then the street, city, state, and the app would locate the address. That doesn't work anymore.",,,,
309,I love the idea of it but I am having a hard time trying to get started. As I am setting up my dailies anything that I set for weekly seemed like they are all linked together so if I change my days on one task it changes on something else. I like what it trying to do but if this isn't corrected then I will have to find another app.,,,,
310,The concept is great however there were multiple instances where I was trying to log in some daily tasks and those tasks weren't recorded. At first I thought I just tapped on the wrong button but the I really made sure I tapped on save on the last instance. I just didn't want to type in everything over again.,,,,
311,"Needs a long way to go. Many street names are missing. The font size is way toooo small - just not useable. I want to travel to Thailand but because of the lack of street names and small font size there is no way that i could use it on my Samsung Galaxy Tab2 with 7 inch screen. At the best it gives me a general idea. It displays English as well as the local language which means nothing to me and only serves to clutter the map. In my home country, Australia, many street names are missing so it is of no use at all. In my opinion if you are going to create an app then at least do a good job. Much better to start small and do one country well first before taking on the whole world.   :-)",,,,

313,"Clunky I have no idea how this has a 4.6 star rating. There's no importing of favorite places. Very unintuitive to set your favorites like home and work. Not user friendly to navigate to your favorites. The voice is very unnatural sounding. Turn directions do not include street name that you're turning onto. Distances read out in feet instead of miles (""turn left in 3000 feet"" vs. 1/2 mile). Finally, it's worse than Google maps about unnecessarily telling you to keep left to stay on the interstate at off ramps.",,,,
314,"I've been using this app for car and pedestrian navigation for years, but this latest version is simply useless for car navigation. I just got back from a weekend car trip in the Netherlands, using the app for each segment to navigate. About 20 (!) times in 2 days the map display would simply freeze. Sometimes for a minute, or 2, or 5, sometimes it just hung and you had to kill the app and restart it. The voice announcements still worked (as did the speed indicator), but since this app's turn-by-turn instructions are often ambiguous and sometimes just plain wrong, you can't rely on them, so having a frozen map is really the worst thing for navigation. We lost quite a bit of time around Arnhem, Oosterbeek, Nijmegen, etc. having to stop at the side of the road to restart the navigation. And that wasn't just on my phone, we also used the app in parallel on my wife's phone and it hung at *exactly* the same places. So the current version would really get only one star for car navigation.",,,,
315,"Interesting concept It has a good base but missing a lot of functionality that i felt would be sort of intuitive to tracking.

318,"App is so-so, value comes from the maps The application has a very limited feature set - basically the only thing that works (well) is showing the zero-cost OSM material. The app renders OK and quickly, but that is already all there is. Quite frankly, other apps based on the skobbler engine draw nicely and very smoothly. In many cases the offline cache of Google Maps is good enough (Japan) and in other areas Google Maps data can actually be downloaded explicitly for a defined region. There is massive room for improvement here.  [Adressing the response to the review: It is not that features are ""bad"". It is the lack of features which I am a bit unhappy about. Combine the (OSM data-driven) features of ""Locus Map"", ""GPS Navigation & Maps"" and ""MapFactor: GPS Navigation"" with the existing feature set and get a very nice app. Aggregate *more* data, make the OSM data more accessible, see for instance the email conversation we had three months ago. Just as an example - the Triposo applications have offline maps based on the (very nice) Skobbler engine. The data they aggregate is all crowd-sourced (i.e. of variable quality), but this app adds a tad bit more offline value.]",,,,
319,"God, I love Wikipedia, but... This app is way below its potential awesomeness. When I hit the back button, one of two things happens: either I am kicked all the way back to the main page, or back to the previous article, but not where I left off. If I ever want to follow a link in an article, then navigate back to that article, I have to search for it again. How can a site as well developed as Wikipedia not have an app with a working 'back' function? And Wikipedia's only response is ""Hey, we're open source, YOU edit it, users!""",,,,

The search function is very frustrating and irritating too, with you not able to fill in a long street name and then add the street number to verify this app can't find that place either. Lack of aerial/satellite overlay option a big minus too. Could have been redeemed by bookmarks that can be imported sensibly.",,,,

323,"This app is a great idea with poor execution. Reminders only sometimes appear, and the UI can be very unresponsive - I've checked daily tasks off, only to find that the app interpreted this as UNchecking the task (since it hadn't registered the fact that it is a new day, yet), which actually subtracts the game resources from you. These problems are significant enough to make the RPG-like rewards system ineffective for me, and the app not worth using as a habit-tracker at this time, sadly.",,,,

So basically, I have no way of informing them of  this issue while the issue is happening. I can't customize my blog theme,  or make posts, or do anything but read other blog's posts because half of  wordpress just looks like a blank page of nothingness.

First, page compositing (especially tables and large images) is exceedingly poor compared to the same page in-browser. You can't even scroll sideways in order to see the entire sidebar.  Second, The complete takeover of the web browser while running is unacceptable. It makes taking a side detour in your search impossible and if you go too deep into links, you have to back ALL the way out of them in order for the app to close itself and return your browser. The only way around this is to kill the process.  Third, the inability to remove the link association in Chrome and Chrome Beta is extremely poor design on the part of the programming team which I would like to see resolved. Basically this makes following links in a google search impossible after the app is uninstalled.",,,,

The first week was hell trying to drive a wide motor home on narrow single lane back roads with oncoming traffic. I did miss the truck but took out the left side mirror on an overhanging sign instead ($457). Often it favored local side roads literally side by side and paralleling expressways.  ______ Update: Maps.me responded asking for my original specific coordinates. I suggested they pick any spot 50 miles outside London and a 2nd spot 50 miles on the opposite side.

At one point, the route it chose added about an hour to a six-hour drive. The triangle icon indicating direction of travel often pointed perpendicular or opposite to the actual direction of travel, or ran alongside the road, or across open fields or bodies of water. Amusing on the autobahn, but a real pain when driving slowly or walking in a city center or small village. Gives very short notice for lane changes/exits. And unlike Google Maps which will say ""slight right"" or ""use right lane,"" this app tends to say only ""turn right!"" Which, again, is confusing. If you can use it, Google Maps is way better.
